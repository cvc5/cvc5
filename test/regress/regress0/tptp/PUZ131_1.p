% Problem  : Victor teaches Michael
% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Every student is enrolled in at least one course. Every professor
%            teaches at least one course. Every course has at least one student
%            enrolled. Every course has at least one professor teaching. The
%            coordinator of a course teaches the course. If a student is
%            enroled in a course then the student is taught by every professor
%            who teaches the course. Michael is enrolled in CSC410. Victor is
%            the coordinator of CSC410. Therefore, Michael is taught by Victor.
