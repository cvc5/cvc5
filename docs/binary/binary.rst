Binary Documentation
====================

The easiest way to use cvc5 is usually to invoke the cvc5 binary via the command line.
The :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>` gives a short introduction on how to use cvc5 via the SMT-LIBv2
interface, but cvc5 also supports other :doc:`input languages <languages>`.
The behavior of cvc5 can be changed with a number of :doc:`options <options>`, and :doc:`output tags <output-tags>` allow to extract structured information about the solving process.

Alternatively, cvc5 features :doc:`several APIs <../api/api>` for different programming languages.
