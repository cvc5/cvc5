API Documentation
=================

In addition to using cvc5 :doc:`as a binary <../binary/binary>`, cvc5 features APIs
for several different programming languages.
While the :doc:`C++ API <cpp/cpp>` is considered the primary interface to cvc5, both the :doc:`Java API <java/java>` and the :doc:`base Python API <python/base/python>` implement a thin wrapper around it.
Additionally, a more pythonic Python API is available at https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5_pythonic_api
and documented :doc:`here <python/pythonic/pythonic>`.
