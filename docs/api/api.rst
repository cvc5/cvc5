API Documentation
=================

In addition to using cvc5 :doc:`as a binary <../binary/binary>`, cvc5 features APIs
for several different programming languages.
While the :doc:`C++ API <cpp/cpp>` is considered the primary interface to cvc5, both the :doc:`Java API <java/index>` and the :doc:`Python API <python/python>` implement a thin wrapper around it.
Additionally, a more pythonic Python API is availble at https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5_z3py_compat.
