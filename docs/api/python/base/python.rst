.. only:: not bindings_python

    .. warning::

        This documentation was built while python bindings were disabled. This part of the documentation is likely either empty or outdated. Please enable :code:`BUILD_BINDINGS_PYTHON` in :code:`cmake` and build the documentation again.

This is the base Python API.
It is an almost exact copy of the :doc:`C++ API <../../cpp/cpp>`.

See the :doc:`pythonic API <../pythonic/pythonic>` for a higher-level programming experience.
