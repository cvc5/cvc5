   * it can assume its children are all rewritten already.
   *
   * This function can return one of three rewrite response codes
   * along with the rewritten node:
   *
   *   REWRITE_DONE indicates that no more rewriting is needed.
   *   REWRITE_AGAIN means that the top-level expression should be
   *     rewritten again, but that its children are in final form.
   *   REWRITE_AGAIN_FULL means that the entire returned expression
   *     should be rewritten again (top-down with preRewrite(), then
   *     bottom-up with postRewrite()).
   *
   * Even if this function returns REWRITE_DONE, if the returned
   * expression belongs to a different theory, it will be fully
   * rewritten by that theory's rewriter.
