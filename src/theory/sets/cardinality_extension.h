/**
 * This class implements a variant of the procedure from Bansal et al, IJCAR
 * 2016. It is used during a full effort check in the following way:
 *    reset(); { registerTerm(n,lemmas); | n in CardTerms }  check();
 * where CardTerms is the set of all applications of CARD in the current
 * context.
 *
 * The remaining public methods are used during model construction, i.e.
 * the collectModelInfo method of the theory of sets.
 *
 * The procedure from Bansal et al IJCAR 2016 introduces the notion of a
 * "cardinality graph", where the nodes of this graph are sets and (directed)
 * edges connect sets to their Venn regions wrt to other sets. For example,
 * if (A \ B) is a term in the current context, then the node A is
 * connected via an edge to child (A \ B). The node (A ^ B) is a child
 * of both A and B. The notion of a cardinality graph is loosely followed
 * in the procedure implemented by this class.
 *
 * The main difference wrt Bansal et al IJCAR 2016 is that the nodes of the
 * cardinality graph considered by this class are not arbitrary set terms, but
 * are instead representatives of equivalence classes. For more details, see
 * documentation of the inference schemas in the private methods of this class.
 *
 * This variant of the procedure takes inspiration from the procedure
 * for word equations in Liang et al, CAV 2014. In that procedure, "normal
 * forms" are generated for String terms by recursively expanding
 * concatentations modulo equality. This procedure similarly maintains
 * normal forms, where the normal form for Set terms is a set of (equivalence
 * class representatives of) Venn regions that do not contain the empty set.

  /** check cardinality cycles
   *
   * The purpose of this inference schema is to construct two data structures:
   *
   * (1) d_card_parent, which maps set terms (A op B) for op in { \, ^ } to
   * equivalence class representatives of their "parents", where:
   *   parent( A ^ B ) = A, B
   *   parent( A \ B ) = A
   * Additionally, (A union B) is a parent of all three of the above sets
   * if it exists as a term in the current context. As exceptions,
   * if A op B = A, then A is not a parent of A ^ B and similarly for B.
   * If A ^ B is empty, then it has no parents.
   *
   * We say the cardinality graph induced by the current set of equalities
   * is an (irreflexive, acyclic) graph whose nodes are equivalence classes and
   * which contains a (directed) edge r1 to r2 if there exists a term t2 in r2
   * that has some parent t1 in r1.
   *
   * (2) d_oSetEqc, an ordered set of equivalence classes whose types are set.
   * These equivalence classes have the property that if r1 is a descendant
   * of r2 in the cardinality graph, then r1 must come before r2 in d_oSetEqc.
   *
   * This inference schema may make various inferences while building these
   * two data structures if the current equality arrangement of sets is not
   * as expected. For example, it will infer equalities between sets based on
   * the emptiness and equalities of sets in adjacent children in the
   * cardinality graph, to give some examples:
   *   (A \ B = empty) => A = A ^ B
   *   A^B = B => B \ A = empty
   *   A union B = A ^ B => A \ B = empty AND B \ A = empty
   * and so on.
   *
   * It will also recognize when a cycle occurs in the cardinality graph, in
   * which case an equality chain between sets can be inferred. For an example,
   * see checkCardCyclesRec below.
   *
   * This method is inspired by the checkCycles inference schema in the theory
   * of strings.

  /** check normal forms
   *
   * This method attempts to assign "normal forms" to all set equivalence
   * classes whose types have cardinality constraints. Normal forms are
   * defined recursively.
   *
   * A "normal form" of an equivalence class [r] (where [r] denotes the
   * equivalence class whose representative is r) is a set of representatives
   * U = { r1, ..., rn }. If there exists at least one set in [r] that has a
   * "flat form", then all sets in the equivalence class have flat form U.
   * If no set in U has a flat form, then U = { r } if r does not contain
   * the empty set, and {} otherwise. Notice that the choice of representative
   * r is determined by the equality engine.
   *
   * A "flat form" of a set term T is the union of the normal forms of the
   * equivalence classes that contain sets whose parent is T.
   *
   * In terms of the cardinality graph, the "flat form" of term t is the set
   * of leaves of t that are descendants of it in the cardinality graph induced
   * by the current set of assertions. Notice a flat form is only defined if t
   * has children. If all terms in an equivalence class E with flat forms have
   * the same flat form, then E is added as a node to the cardinality graph with
   * edges connecting to all equivalence classes with terms that have a parent
   * in E.
   *
   * In the following inference schema, the argument intro_sets is updated to
   * contain the set of new set terms that the procedure is requesting to
   * introduce for the purpose of forcing the flat forms of two equivalent sets
   * to become identical. If any equivalence class cannot be assigned a normal
   * form, then the resulting intro_sets is guaranteed to be non-empty.
   *
   * As an example, say we have a context with equivalence classes:
   *   {A, D}, {C, A^B}, {E, C^D}, {C\D}, {D\C}, {A\B}, {empty, B\A},
   * where assume the first term in each set is its representative. An ordered
   * list d_oSetEqc for this context:
   *   A, C, E, C\D, D\C, A\B, empty, ...
   * The normal form of {empty, B\A} is {}, since it contains the empty set.
   * The normal forms for each of the singleton equivalence classes are
   * themselves.
   * The flat form of each of E and C^D does not exist, hence the normal form
   * of {E, C^D} is {E}.
   * The flat form of C is {E, C\D}, noting that C^D and C\D are terms whose
   * parent is C, hence {E, C\D} is the normal form for class {C, A^B}.
   * The flat form of A is {E, C\D, A\B} and the flat form of D is {E, D\C}.
   * Hence, no normal form can be assigned to class {A, D}. Instead this method
   * will e.g. add (C\D)^E to intro_sets, which will force the solver
   * to explore a model where the Venn regions (C\D)^E (C\D)\E and E\(C\D) are
   * considered while constructing flat forms. Splitting on whether these sets
   * are empty will eventually lead to a model where the flat forms of A and D
   * are the same.
