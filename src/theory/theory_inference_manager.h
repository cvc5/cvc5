/**
 * The base class for inference manager. An inference manager is a wrapper
 * around the output channel and the official equality engine of a Theory.
 * It is used for ensuring that the equality engine and output channel
 * are used properly. This includes the following invariants:
 *
 * (1) The state tracks conflicts.
 * In particular, TheoryState::isInConflict returns true whenever we have
 * called OutputChannel::conflict in the current context, which we enforce
 * by always setting d_state.notifyInConflict at the same time we send
 * conflicts on the output channel.
 *
 * (2) The theory is notified of (internal) facts.
 * In particular, Theory::preNotifyFact and Theory::notifyFact are called
 * (with isInternal = true) whenever we assert internal facts using
 * assertFactInernal below, mirroring what is done for facts from the fact
 * queue (where isInternal = false).
 *
 * (3) The proof equality engine is used whenever proofs are enabled (when
 * the proof node manager provided to this class is non-null). Notice this
 * class automatically will construct a proof equality engine during
 * setEqualityEngine, and use it for handling variants of assertInternalFact
 * below that involve proofs.
