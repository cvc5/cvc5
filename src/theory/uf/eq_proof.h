   *  (= t1 t2) (= t3 t2) (= (t1 t3) false)
   *  ------------------------------------- EQP::TR
   *             false = true

   *                                          (= t3 t2)
   *                                          --------- SYMM
   *                                (= t1 t2) (= t2 t3)

   *  ----------------------------------------------- TRANS
   *             false = true
   *
   * by explicitly adding the transitivity step for inferring (= t1 t3) and its
   * predicate equality. Note that we differentiate (from now on) the EqProof
   * rules ids from those of ProofRule by adding the prefix EQP:: to the former.
   *
   * In the other case, the general shape of the EqProof is
   *
   *  (= (= t1 t2) false) (= t1 x1) ... (= xn t3) (= t2 y1) ... (= ym t4)
   * ------------------------------------------------------------------- EQP::TR

   *   (= t3 t1)                    (= t4 t2)

   *          --------------------- MACRO_SR_PRED_TRANSFORM
   *           (= (= t4 t3) false)
   *
   * whereas the last step is only necessary if the conclusion has the arguments
   * in reverse order than expected. Note that the original step represents two
   * substitutions happening on the disequality, from t1->t3 and t2->t4, which
   * are implicitly justified by transitivity steps that need to be made
   * explicity. Since there is no sense of ordering among which premisis (other
   * than (= (= t1 t2) false)) are used for which substitution, the transitivity
   * proofs are built greedly by searching the sets of premises.

   * build a chain (= t1 t2) ... (= tn-1 tn) from premises. This is done in a
   * greedy manner by finding one "link" in the chain at a time, updating the
   * conclusion to be the next link and the premises by removing the used
   * premise, and searching recursively.
   *

   * In the first equality it finds t2 and also t4, which closes the chain, so

   * order in which the equalities are chosen. When a recursive call fails to
   * close a chain, the chosen equality is dismissed and another is searched for
   * among the remaining ones.
   *
   * This method assumes that premises does not contain reflexivity premises.
   * This is without loss of generality since such premises are spurious for a
   * transitivity step.

  /** Reduce the a congruence EqProof into a transitivity matrix
   *
   * Given a congruence EqProof of (= (f a0 ... an-1) (f b0 ... bn-1)), reduce
   * its justification into a matrix
   *
   *   [0]   -> p_{0,0} ... p_{m_0,0}
   *   ...
   *   [n-1] -> p_{0,n} ... p_{m_n-1,n-1}
   *
   * where f has arity n and each p_{0,i} ... p_{m_i, i} is a transitivity chain
   * (modulo ordering) justifying (= ai bi).
   *
   * Congruence steps in EqProof are binary, representing reasoning over curried
   * applications. In the simplest case the general shape of a congruence
   * EqProof is:
   *                                     P0
   *              ------- EQP::REFL  ----------
   *       P1        []               (= a0 b0)
   *  ---------   ----------------------- EQP::CONG
   *  (= a1 b1)             []                        P2
   *  ------------------------- EQP::CONG        -----------
   *             []                               (= a2 b2)
   *          ------------------------------------------------ EQP::CONG
   *                  (= (f a0 a1 a2) (f b0 b1 b2))
   *
   * where [] stands for the null node, symbolizing "equality between partial
   * applications".
   *
   * The reduction of such a proof is done by
   * - converting the proof of the second CONG premise (via addToProof) and
   *   adding the resulting node to row i of the matrix
   * - recursively reducing the first proof with i-1
   *
   * In the above case the transitivity matrix would thus be
   *   [0] -> (= a0 b0)
   *   [1] -> (= a1 b1)
   *   [2] -> (= a2 b2)
   *
   * The more complex case of congruence proofs has transitivity steps as the
   * first child of CONG steps. For example
   *                                     P0
   *              ------- EQP::REFL  ----------
   *     P'          []            (= a0 c)
   *  ---------   ----------------------------- EQP::CONG
   *  (= b0 c)             []                               P1
   * ------------------------- EQP::TRANS             -----------
   *            []                                     (= a1 b1)
   *         ----------------------------------------------------- EQP::CONG
   *                          (= (f a0 a1) (f b0 b1))
   *
   * where when the first child of CONG is a transitivity step
   * - the premises that are CONG steps are recursively reduced with *the same*
       argument i
   * - the other premises are processed with addToProof and added to the i row
   *   in the matrix
   *
   * In the above example the to which the transitivity matrix is
   *   [0] -> (= a0 c), (= b0 c)
   *   [1] -> (= a1 b1)
   *
   * The remaining complication is that when conclusion is an equality of n-ary
   * applications of *different* arities, there is, necessarily, a transitivity
   * step as a first child a CONG step whose conclusion is an equality of n-ary
   * applications of different arities. For example
   *             P0                              P1
   * -------------------------- EQP::TRANS  -----------
   *     (= (f a0 a1) (f b0))                (= a2 b1)
   * -------------------------------------------------- EQP::CONG
   *              (= (f a0 a1 a2) (f b0 b1))
   *
   * will be first reduced with i = 2 (maximal arity amorg the original
   * conclusion's applications), adding (= a2 b1) to row 2 after processing
   * P1. The first child is reduced with i = 1. Since it is a TRANS step whose
   * conclusion is an equality of n-ary applications with mismatching arity, P0
   * is processed with addToProof and the result is added to row 1. Thus the
   * transitivity matrix is
   *   [0] ->
   *   [1] -> (= (f a0 a1) (f b0))
   *   [2] -> (= a2 b1)
   *
   * The empty row 0 is used by the original caller of reduceNestedCongruence to
   * compute that the above congruence proof's conclusion is
   *   (= (f (f a0 a1) a2) (f (f b0) b1))
   *
   * @param i the i-th argument of the congruent applications, initially being
