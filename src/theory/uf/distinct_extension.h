  // distinct constraints that they occur in. For example, if we have an
  // equivalence class {a, b} where a is the representative, and
  // distinct(b,c,d) distinct(e,f,a) are constraints, then for example:
  // d_ndistinct[a] = 2,
  // d_eqcToDistinct[a] = {distinct(b,c,d), distinct(e,f,a)},
  // d_eqcToDMem[a] = {b,a}

  // d_ndistinct[d] = 1,
  // d_eqcToDistinct[d] = {distinct(b,c,d)},

  // If {a,b} and {d} merge, we recognize a conflict since distinct(b,c,d) is
  // in both lists (d_eqcToDistinct[a] and d_eqcToDistinct[d]), where b=d is
  // the explanation for the conflict, accessible via d_eqcToDMem. In particular
  // d_eqcToDMem[a] indicates that b is the child of distinct(b,c,d) that is
  // in the equivalence class of a, and similarly d_eqcToDMem[d] indicates that
