/** The higher-order extension of the theory of uninterpreted functions
 *
 * This extension is capable of handling UF constraints involving partial
 * applications via the applicative encoding (kind HO_APPLY), and
 * (dis)equalities involving function sorts. It uses a lazy applicative
 * encoding and implements two axiom schemes, at a high level:
 *
 * (1) Extensionality, where disequalities between functions witnessed by
 * arguments where the two functions differ,
 *
 * (2) App-Encode, where full applications of UF (kind APPLY_UF) are equated
 * with curried applications (kind HO_APPLY).
 *
 * For more details, see "Extending SMT Solvers to Higher-Order", Barbosa et al.
