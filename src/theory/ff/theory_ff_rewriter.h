  /**
   * Rewrite a node into the normal form for the theory of ff.
   * Called in post-order (really reverse-topological order) when
   * traversing the expression DAG during rewriting.  This is the
   * main function of the rewriter, and because of the ordering,
   * it can assume its children are all rewritten already.
   *
   * This function can return one of three rewrite response codes
   * along with the rewritten node:
   *
   *   REWRITE_DONE indicates that no more rewriting is needed.
   *   REWRITE_AGAIN means that the top-level expression should be
   *     rewritten again, but that its children are in final form.
   *   REWRITE_AGAIN_FULL means that the entire returned expression
   *     should be rewritten again (top-down with preRewrite(), then
   *     bottom-up with postRewrite()).
   *
   * Even if this function returns REWRITE_DONE, if the returned
   * expression belongs to a different theory, it will be fully
   * rewritten by that theory's rewriter.
   *
   * Ensures:
   *  - addition and multiplication results are flat
   *  - addition and multiplication terms have at most one constant, in the
   *    final position
   *  - addition terms do not have the 0 constant
   *  - multiplication terms do not have a 0 or 1 constant
