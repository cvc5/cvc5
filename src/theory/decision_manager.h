/** DecisionManager
 *
 * This class manages all "decision strategies" for theory solvers in
 * TheoryEngine. A decision strategy is a callback in the SAT solver for
 * imposing its next decision. This is useful, for instance, in
 * branch-and-bound algorithms where we require that the first decision
 * is a bound on some quantity. For instance, finite model finding may impose
 * a bound on the cardinality of an uninterpreted sort as the first decision.
 *
 * This class maintains a user-context-dependent set of pointers to
 * DecisionStrategy objects, which implement indivdual decision strategies.
 *
 * Decision strategies may be registered to this class via registerStrategy
 * at any time during solving. They are cleared via a call to reset during
 * TheoryEngine's postSolve method.
 *
 * Decision strategies have a fixed order, which is managed by the enumeration
 * type StrategyId, where strategies with smaller id have higher precedence
 * in our global decision strategy.
