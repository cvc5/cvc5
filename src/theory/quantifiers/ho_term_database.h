   * This registers additional terms corresponding to (possibly multiple)
   * purifications of a higher-order term n.
   *
   * Consider the example:
   *    g : Int -> Int, f : Int x Int -> Int
   *    constraints: (@ f 0) = g, (f 0 1) = (@ (@ f 0) 1) = 3
   *    pattern: (g x)
   * where @ is HO_APPLY.
   * We have that (g x){ x -> 1 } is an E-match for (@ (@ f 0) 1).
   * With the standard registration in addTerm, we construct term indices for
   *   f, g, @ : Int x Int -> Int, @ : Int -> Int.
   * However, to match (g x) with (@ (@ f 0) 1), we require that
   *   [1] -> (@ (@ f 0) 1)
   * is an entry in the term index of g. To do this, we maintain a term
   * index for a fresh variable pfun, the purification variable for
   * (@ f 0). Thus, we register the term (pfun 1) in the call to this function
   * for (@ (@ f 0) 1). This ensures that, when processing the equality
   * (@ f 0) = g, we merge the term indices of g and pfun. Hence, the entry
   *   [1] -> (@ (@ f 0) 1)
   * is added to the term index of g, assuming g is the representative of
   * the equivalence class of g and pfun.
   *
   * Above, we set d_hoFunOpPurify[(@ f 0)] = pfun, and
   * d_hoPurifyToTerm[(pfun 1)] = (@ (@ f 0) 1).
