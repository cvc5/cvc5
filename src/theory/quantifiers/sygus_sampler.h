/** SygusSampler
 *
 * This class can be used to test whether two expressions are equivalent
 * by random sampling. We use this class for the following options:
 *
 * sygus-rr-synth: synthesize candidate rewrite rules by finding two terms
 * t1 and t2 do not rewrite to the same term, but are identical when considering
 * a set of sample points, and
 *
 * sygus-rr-verify: detect unsound rewrite rules by finding two terms t1 and
 * t2 that rewrite to the same term, but not identical when considering a set
 * of sample points.
 *
 * To use this class:
 * (1) Call initialize( tds, f, nsamples) where f is sygus datatype term.
 * (2) For terms n1....nm enumerated that correspond to builtin analog of sygus
 * term f, we call registerTerm( n1 )....registerTerm( nm ). It may be the case
 * that registerTerm( ni ) returns nj for some j < i. In this case, we have that
 * ni and nj are equivalent under the sample points in this class.
 *
 * For example, say the grammar for f is:
 *   A = 0 | 1 | x | y | A+A | ite( B, A, A )
 *   B = A <= A
 * If we call initialize( tds, f, 5 ), this class will generate 5 random sample
 * points for (x,y), say (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,0), (2,2). The return values
 * of successive calls to registerTerm are listed below.
 *   registerTerm( 0 ) -> 0
 *   registerTerm( x ) -> x
 *   registerTerm( x+y ) -> x+y
 *   registerTerm( y+x ) -> x+y
 *   registerTerm( x+ite(x <= 1+1, 0, y ) ) -> x
 * Notice that the number of sample points can be configured for the above
 * options using sygus-samples=N.
