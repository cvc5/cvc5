 * getInternalRepresentative, which is used by instantiation-based methods
 * that are agnostic with respect to choosing terms within an equivalence class.
 * Examples of such methods are finite model finding and enumerative
 * instantiation. Method getInternalRepresentative returns the "best"
 * representative based on the internal heuristic, which is currently based on
 * choosing the term that was previously chosen as a representative earliest.

   * are ineligible. As a result, this function may return
