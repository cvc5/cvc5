 * In the methods below, we support the enumerators based on the following idea.
 * The tuples are represented as tuples of
 * indices of  terms, where the tuple has as many elements as there are
 * quantified variables in the considered quantifier q.
 *
 * Like so, we see a tuple as a number, where the digits may have different
 * ranges. The most significant digits are stored first.
 *
 * Tuples are enumerated in a lexicographic order in stages. There are 2
 * possible strategies, either all tuples in a given stage have the same sum of
 * digits, or, the maximum over these digits is the same (controlled by
 * TermTupleEnumeratorEnv::d_increaseSum).
 *
 * In this method, the returned enumerator draws ground terms from the term
 * database (provided by td). The quantifiers state (qs) is used to eliminate
 * duplicates modulo equality.
