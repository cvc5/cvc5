 *
 * This module is used to repair portions of candidate solutions. In particular,
 * given a synthesis conjecture:
 *   exists f. forall x. P( f, x )
 * and a candidate solution f = \x. t[x,r] where r are repairable terms, this
 * function checks whether there exists a term of the form \x. t[x,c'] for some
 * constants c' such that:
 *   forall x. P( (\x. t[x,c']), x )  [***]
 * is satisfiable, where notice that the above formula after beta-reduction may
 * be one in pure first-order logic in a decidable theory (say linear
 * arithmetic). To check this, we invoke a separate instance of the SmtEngine
 * within repairSolution(...) below, which if satisfiable gives us the
 * valuation for c'.

   * candidate_values to be repairable. In addition, if the flag

   * The repaired solution has the property that it satisfies the synthesis
