/** Streamer of concrete values for enumerator
 *
 * When a given enumerator is "variable agnostic", only values in which
 * variables are ordered are chosen for it (see
 * TermDbSygus::registerEnumerator). If such values are seen as "abstract", in
 * the sense that each represent a set of values, this class can be used to
 * stream all the concrete values that correspond to them.
 *
 * For example a variable agnostic enumerator that contains three variables, x1,
 * x2, x3, in which x1 < x2 < x3, for which an "abstract" value (OP x1 x2) is
 * derived, will lead to the stream of "concrete" values
 *
 * (OP x1 x2)
 * (OP x1 x3)
 * (OP x2 x3)
 *
 * (OP x2 x1)
 * (OP x3 x1)
 * (OP x3 x2)
 *
 * in which for each permutation of the variables in the abstract value ([x1,
 * x2] and [x2, x1] in the above) we generate all the substitutions through
 * ordered combinations of the variables of the enumerator ([x1, x2], [x1, x3],
 * and [x2, x3] in the above).
 *
 * Moreover the permutations are generated modulo rewriting, s.t. if two
 * permutations are equivalent, only one is used.
 *
 * It should be noted that the variables of a variable agnostic enumerator are
 * kept in independent "subclasses" (see TermDbSygus::getSubclassForVar).
 * Therefore when streaming concrete values, permutations and combinations are
 * generated by the product of the permutations and combinations of each class.
