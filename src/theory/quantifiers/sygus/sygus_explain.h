/*The SygusExplain utility
 *
 * This class is used to produce explanations for refinement lemmas
 * in the counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) loop.
 *
 * When given an invariance test T traverses the AST of a given term,
 * uses TermRecBuild to replace various subterms by fresh variables and
 * recheck whether the invariant, as specified by T still holds.
 * If it does, then we may exclude the explanation for that subterm.
 *
 * For example, say we have that the current value of
 * (datatype) sygus term n is:
 *  (if (gt x 0) 0 0)
 * where if, gt, x, 0 are datatype constructors.
 * The explanation returned by getExplanationForEquality
 * below for n and the above term is:
 *   { ((_ is if) n), ((_ is geq) n.0),
 *     ((_ is x) n.0.0), ((_ is 0) n.0.1),
 *     ((_ is 0) n.1), ((_ is 0) n.2) }
 *
 * This class can also return more precise
 * explanations based on a property that holds for
 * variants of n. For instance,
 * say we find that n's builtin analog rewrites to 0:
 *  ite( x>0, 0, 0 ) ----> 0
 * and we would like to find the minimal explanation for
 * why the builtin analog of n rewrites to 0.
 * We use the invariance test EquivSygusInvarianceTest
 * (see sygus_invariance.h) for doing this.
 * Using the SygusExplain::getExplanationFor method below,
 * this will invoke the invariant test to check, e.g.
 *   ite( x>0, 0, y1 ) ----> 0 ? fail
 *   ite( x>0, y2, 0 ) ----> 0 ? fail
 *   ite( y3, 0, 0 ) ----> 0 ? success
 * where y1, y2, y3 are fresh variables.
 * Hence the explanation for the condition x>0 is irrelevant.
 * This gives us the explanation:
 *   { ((_ is if) n), ((_ is 0) n.1), ((_ is 0) n.2) }
 * indicating that all terms of the form:
 *   (if _ 0 0) have a builtin equivalent that rewrites to 0.
 *
 * For details, see Reynolds et al SYNT 2017.
 *
 * Below, we let [[exp]]_n denote the term induced by
 * the explanation exp for n.
 * For example:
 *   exp = { ((_ is plus) n), ((_ is y) n.1) }
 * is such that:
 *   [[exp]]_n = (plus w y)
 * where w is a fresh variable.
