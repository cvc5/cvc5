/** SygusReconstruct
 *
 * This class implements an algorithm for reconstructing a given term such that
 * the reconstructed term is equivalent to the original term and its syntax
 * matches a specified grammar.
 *
 * Goal: find a term g in sygus type T0 that is equivalent to builtin term t0.
 *
 * rcons(t0, T0) returns g
 * {
 *   Obs: A set of pairs to reconstruct into T, where each pair is of the form
 *        (k, ts), where k is a skolem of a sygus type T and ts is a set of
 *        builtin terms of the type encoded by T.
 *
 *   Terms: A map from skolems k to a set of builtin terms in the pairs (k, ts).
 *          That is, Terms[k] = ts.
 *
 *   Sol: A map from skolems k to (possibly null) sygus terms of type T
 *        representing solutions to the obligations.
 *
 *   CandSols : A map from a skolem k to a set of possible solutions for its
 *              corresponding obligation. Whenever there is a successful match,
 *              it is added to this set.
 *
 *   Pool : A map from a sygus type T to a set of enumerated terms in T.
 *          The terms in this pool are patterns whose builtin analogs are used
 *          for matching against the terms to reconstruct ts in (k, ts).

  /** Match builtin term `t` with pattern `sz`.
   *
   * This function matches the builtin term to reconstruct `t` with the builtin
   * analog of the pattern `sz`. If the match succeeds, `sz` is added to the set
   * of candidate solutions for the obligation `ob` corresponding to the builtin
   * term `t` and a set of new sub-terms to reconstruct is returned. If there
   * are no new sub-terms to reconstruct, then `sz` is considered a solution to
   * obligation `ob` and `markSolved(ob, sz)` is called. For example, given:
   *
   * Obs = [(k0, {(+ 1 1)})]
   * Pool[T0] = {(c_+ z1 z2)}
   * CandSols = {}
   *
   * Then calling `matchNewObs((+ 1 1), (c_+ z1 z2))` will result in:
   *
   * Obs = [(k0, {(+ 1 1)}), (k1, {1})]
   * Pool[T0] = {(c_+ z1 z2)}
   * CandSols = {k0 -> {(c_+ k1 k1)}}
   *
   * and will return `{T0 -> {1}}`.
   *
   * Notice that the patterns/shapes in pool are generic, and thus, contain vars
   * `z` as opposed to skolems `k`. Also, notice that `(c_+ z1 z2)` is
   * instantiated with only one skolem `k1`, which is then added to the set of
   * obligations. That's because the builtin analogs of `z1` and `z2` match with
   * the same builtin term `1`.
   *
   * @param t builtin term we need to reconstruct
   * @param sz a pattern to match against `t`
