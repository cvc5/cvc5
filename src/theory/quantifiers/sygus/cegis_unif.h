/** Cegis Unif Enumerators Decision Strategy
 *
 * This class enforces a decision strategy that limits the number of
 * unique values given to the set of heads of evaluation points and conditions
 * enumerators for these points, which are variables of sygus datatype type that
 * are introduced by CegisUnif.
 *
 * It maintains a set of guards, call them G_uq_1 ... G_uq_n, where the
 * semantics of G_uq_i is "for each type, the heads of evaluation points of that
 * type are interpreted as a value in a set whose cardinality is at most i".
 * We also enforce that the number of condition enumerators for evaluation
 * points is equal to (n-1).
 *
 * To enforce this, we introduce sygus enumerator(s) of the same type as the
 * heads of evaluation points and condition enumerators registered to this class
 * and add lemmas that enforce that these terms are equal to at least one
 * enumerator (see registerEvalPtAtSize).
