   * occur as arguments of unification functions.

   * A vector of guards with the (negated) equalities between the original

   * applicatin of a non-unif function-to-synthesize is reached, the requirement
   * is lifted (the ensureConst becomes "false"). This avoides introducing
   * spurious equalities in model_guards.
   *
   * For example if "f" is being synthesized with a unification strategy and "g"
   * is not then the application
   *   f(g(f(g(0))))=1
