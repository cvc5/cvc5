/** SygusPbe
 *
 * This class implements optimizations that target synthesis conjectures
 * that are in Programming-By-Examples (PBE) form.
 *
 * [EX#1] An example of a synthesis conjecture in PBE form is :
 * exists f. forall x.
 * ( f( 0 ) = 2 ) ^ ( f( 5 ) = 7 ) ^ ( f( 6 ) = 8 )
 *
 * We say that the above conjecture has I/O examples (0)->2, (5)->7, (6)->8.
 *
 * Internally, this class does the following for SyGuS inputs:
 *
 * (1) Infers whether the input conjecture is in PBE form or not, which
 *     is based on looking up information in the ExampleInfer utility.
 * (2) Based on this information and on the syntactic restrictions, it
 *     devises a strategy for enumerating terms and construction solutions,
 *     which is inspired by Alur et al. "Scaling Enumerative Program Synthesis
 *     via Divide and Conquer" TACAS 2017. In particular, it may consider
 *     strategies for constructing decision trees when the grammar permits ITEs
 *     and a strategy for divide-and-conquer string synthesis when the grammar
 *     permits string concatenation. This is managed through the SygusUnif
 *     utilities, d_sygus_unif.
 * (3) It makes (possibly multiple) calls to
 *     TermDatabaseSygus::regstierEnumerator(...) based
 *     on the strategy, which inform the rest of the system to enumerate values
 *     of particular types in the grammar through use of fresh variables which
 *     we call "enumerators".
 *
 * Points (1)-(3) happen within a call to SygusPbe::initialize(...).
 *
 * Notice that each enumerator is associated with a single
 * function-to-synthesize, but a function-to-sythesize may be mapped to multiple
 * enumerators. Some public functions of this class expect an enumerator as
 * input, which we map to a function-to-synthesize via
 * TermDatabaseSygus::getSynthFunFor(e).
 *
 * An enumerator is initially "active" but may become inactive if the
 * enumeration exhausts all possible values in the datatype corresponding to
 * syntactic restrictions for it. The search may continue unless all enumerators
 * become inactive.
 *
 * (4) When the extension of quantifier-free datatypes procedure for SyGuS
 *     datatypes terminates with a model, the parent of this class calls
 *     SygusPbe::getCandidateList(...), where this class returns the list
 *     of active enumerators.
 * (5) The parent class subsequently calls
 *     SygusPbe::constructValues(...), which informs this class that new
 *     values have been enumerated for active enumerators, as indicated by the
 *     current model. This call also requests that based on these
 *     newly enumerated values, whether this class is now able to construct a
 *     solution based on the high-level strategy (stored in d_sygus_unif).
 *
 * This class is not designed to work in incremental mode, since there is no way
 * to specify incremental problems in SyguS.

   *
   * This function attempts to use unification-based approaches for constructing
   * solutions for all functions-to-synthesize (indicated by candidates). These
   * approaches include decision tree learning and a divide-and-conquer
   * algorithm based on string concatenation.
   *
   * Calls to this function are such that terms is the list of active
   * enumerators (returned by getTermList), and term_values are their current
   * model values. This function registers { terms -> terms_values } in
   * the database of values that have been enumerated, which are in turn used
   * for constructing candidate solutions when possible.
   *
   * This function also excludes models where (terms = terms_values) by adding
   * blocking clauses to lems. For example, for grammar:
   *   A -> A+A | x | 1 | 0
   * and a call where terms = { d } and term_values = { +( x, 1 ) }, it adds:
   *   ~G V ~is_+( d ) V ~is_x( d.1 ) V ~is_1( d.2 )
   * to lems, where G is active guard of the enumerator d (see
   * TermDatabaseSygus::getActiveGuardForEnumerator). This blocking clause
   * indicates that d should not be given the model value +( x, 1 ) anymore,
   * since { d -> +( x, 1 ) } has now been added to the database of this class.
