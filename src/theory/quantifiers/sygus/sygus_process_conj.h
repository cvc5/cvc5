/** This file contains techniques that compute
 * argument relevancy for synthesis functions
 *
 * Let F be a synthesis conjecture of the form:
 *   exists f. forall X. P( f, X )
 *
 * The classes below compute whether certain arguments of
 * the function-to-synthesize f are irrelevant.
 * Assume that f is a binary function, where possible solutions
 * to the above conjecture are of the form:
 *   f -> (lambda (xy) t[x,y])
 * We say e.g. that the 2nd argument of f is irrelevant if we
 * can determine:
 *   F has a solution
 * if and only if
 *   F has a solution of the form f -> (lambda (xy) t[x] )
 * We conclude that arguments are irrelevant using the following
 * techniques.
 *
 *
 * (1) Argument invariance:
 *
 * Let s[z] be a term whose free variables are contained in { z }.
 * If all occurrences of f-applications in F are of the form:
 *   f(t, s[t])
 * then:
 *   f = (lambda (xy) r[x,y])
 * is a solution to F only if:
 *   f = (lambda (xy) r[x,s[x]])
 * is as well.
 * Hence the second argument of f is not relevant.
 *
 *
 * (2) Variable irrelevance:
 *
 * If F is equivalent to:
 *   exists f. forall w z u1...un. C1 ^...^Cm,
 * where for i=1...m, Ci is of the form:
 *   ( w1 = f(tm1[z], u1) ^
 *     ... ^
 *     wn = f(tmn[z], un) ) => Pm(w1...wn, z)
 * then the second argument of f is irrelevant.
 * We call u1...un single occurrence variables
 * (in Ci).
 *
 *
 * TODO (#1210) others, generalize (2)?
