 * This is an utility for the SMT-LIB command (get-interpol <term>).
 * The utility turns a set of quantifier-free assertions into a sygus
 * conjecture that encodes an interpolation problem, and then solve the
 * interpolation problem by synthesizing it. In detail, if our input formula is
 * F( x ) for free symbol x, and is partitioned into axioms Fa and conjecture Fc
 * then the sygus conjecture we construct is:
 *
 * (Fa( x ) => A( x )) ^ (A( x ) => Fc( x ))
 *
 * where A( x ) is a predicate over the free symbols of our input that are
 * shared between Fa and Fc. In other words, A( x ) must be implied by our
 * axioms Fa( x ) and implies Fc( x ). Then, to solve the interpolation problem,
 * we just need to synthesis A( x ).
 *
 * This class uses a fresh copy of the SMT engine which is used for solving the
 * interpolation problem. In particular, consider the input: (assert A)
 *   (get-interpol s B)
 * In the copy of the SMT engine where these commands are issued, we maintain
 * A in the assertion stack. In solving the interpolation problem, we will
 * need to call a SMT engine solver with a different assertion stack, which is
 * a sygus conjecture build from A and B. Then to solve the interpolation
 * problem, instead of modifying the assertion stack to remove A and add the
 * sygus conjecture (exists I. ...), we invoke a fresh copy of the SMT engine
 * and leave the original assertion stack unchanged. This copy of the SMT
 * engine will have the assertion stack with the sygus conjecture. This copy
 * of the SMT engine can be further queried for information regarding further
 * solutions.
