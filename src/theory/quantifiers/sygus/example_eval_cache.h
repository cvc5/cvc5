/** ExampleEvalCache
 *
 * This class caches the evaluation of nodes on a fixed list of examples. It
 * serves two purposes:
 * (1) To maintain a cache of the results of evaluation of nodes so that
 * evaluation is not recomputed in different contexts, and
 * (2) To maintain a trie of terms indexed by their evaluation on the list
 * of examples to recognize when two terms are equivalent up to examples.
 *
 * This class is associated with a function to synthesize and an enumerator,
 * which determine which examples are taken from the conjecture and how
 * to evaluate builtin terms.
 *
 * The use of (1) is required since we may be interested in computing the
 * evaluation of terms on a fixed set of points P, and reusing it in multiple
 * contexts, including:
 * - Computing whether a term evaluates the same as another one on P,
 * - Computing which I/O pairs a term satisfies (for decision tree learning)
 * whose inputs are P,
 * - Checking whether the term satisfies refinement lemmas where the function
 * to synthesize is solely applied to points in P.
 *
 * A typical use case of (2) is the following.
 * During search, the extension of quantifier-free datatypes procedure for
 * SyGuS datatypes may ask this class whether current candidates can be
 * discarded based on inferring when two candidate solutions are equivalent
 * up to examples. For example, the candidate solutions:
 *     f = \x ite( x < 0, x+1, x ) and f = \x x
 * are equivalent up to examples on a conjecture like:
 *     exists f. f(0) = 1 ^ f(5) = 2 ^ f(6) = 3
 * since they have the same value on the points x = 0,5,6. Hence, we need only
 * consider one of them. The interface for querying this is
 *       ExampleEvalCache::addSearchVal(...).
 * For details, see Reynolds et al. SYNT 2017.

   *
   * This function can be called by the extension of quantifier-free datatypes
   * procedure for SyGuS datatypes or the SyGuS fast enumerator when we are
   * considering a value of enumerator e passed to the constructor of this
   * class whose analog in the signature of builtin theory is bvr.
   * 
   * The type tn passed to this function is the sygus type of the term whose
   * builtin equivalent is bvr. Terms with distinct types must be cached
   * independently since two sygus types may not generate the same terms.
   *
   * This returns either:
   * - A term that is equivalent to bvr up to examples that was passed as the
   * argument to a previous call to addSearchVal, or
   * - bvr, indicating that no previous terms are equivalent to bvr up to
   * examples,
   * - null, indicating that symmetry breaking could not be applied (e.g.
   * if the enumerator of this class is variable agnostic).
   *
   * If this method returns bvr (indicating it is not redundant), the
   * result of the evaluation of bvr is cached by this class, and can be
   * later accessed by evaluateVec below.
