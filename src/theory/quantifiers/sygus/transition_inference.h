 * Utility for storing a deterministic trace of a transition system. A trace

 * the variables of transition system. For example, say we have a transition
 * system with variables x,y,z. Say the precondition constrains these variables
 * to x=1,y=2,z=3, and say that the transition relation admits the single
 * trace: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5]. We store these three vectors of variables
 * in the trie within this class.

 * This utility is used for determining whether a transition system has a
