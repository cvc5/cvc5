/** CegisCoreConnective
 *
 * A sygus module that is specialized in handling conjectures of the form:
 * exists P. forall x. (A[x] => C(x)) ^ (C(x) => B(x))
 * That is, conjectures with a pre/post condition but no inductive relation
 * or other constraints. Additionally, we may have that the above conjecture
 * has a side condition SC, which requires that exists x. SC[x]^C(x) is
 * satisfiable.
 *
 * Two examples of this kind of sygus conjecture are abduction and
 * interpolation.
 *
 * This module implements a specific algorithm for constructing solutions
 * to this conjecture based on Boolean connectives and unsat cores, described
 * in following. We give two variants of the algorithm, both implemented as
 * special cases of this class. Below, let:
 *
 * pool(A) be a set of literals { c_1, ..., c_n } s.t. c_i => B for i=1,...,n,
 * pts(A) : a set of points { v | A[v] is true },
 * pool(B) : a set of literals { d_1, ..., d_m } s.t. A => d_i for i=1,...,m,
 * pts(B) : a set of points { v | ~B[v] is true },
 * cores(B) : a set of sets of literals { U_1, ..., U_p } s.t. for i=1,...,p:
 * - U_i is a subset of pool(B),
 * - A ^ U_i is unsat.
 * We construct pool(A)/pool(B) using enumerative SyGuS, discarding the literals
 * that do not match the criteria.
 *
 * Variant #1 (Interpolation)
 *
 * Let the synthesis conjecture be of the form
 *   exists C. forall x. A[x] => C[x] ^ C[x] => B[x]
 *
 * The high level idea is we construct solutions for C of the form
 *   c_1 OR ... OR c_n where c_i => B for each i=1,...,n, or
 *   d_1 AND ... AND d_m where A => d_i for each i=1,...,m.
 *
 * while(true){
 *   Let e_i = next_sygus_enum();
 *   // check if e_i should be added to pool(B)
 *   if e_i[v] is true for all v in pts(A)
 *     if A => e_i
 *       pool(B) += e_i;
 *     else
 *       pts(A) += { v } where { x -> v } is a model for A ^ ~e_i;
 *   // try to construct a solution based on the pool
 *   Let D = {}.
 *   while
 *     D[v] is true for some v in pts(B), and
 *     d'[v] is false for some d' in pool(B)
 *   {
 *     D += { d' }
 *     if D is false for all v in pts(B)
 *       if D => B
 *         return AND_{d in D}( d )
 *       else
 *         pts(B) += { v } where { x -> v } is a model for D ^ ~B
 *   }
 *
 *   // analogous for the other direction
 * }
 *
 *
 * Variant #2 (Abduction)
 *
 * Let the synthesis conjecture be of the form exists C. forall x. C[x] => B[x]
 * such that S[x] ^ C[x] is satisfiable. We refer to S as the side condition
 * for this conjecture. Notice that A in this variant is false, hence the
 * algorithm below is modified accordingly.
 *
 * The high level idea is we construct solutions for C of the form
 *   d_1 AND ... AND d_n
 * where the above conjunction is weakened based on only including conjuncts
 * that are in the unsat core of d_1 AND ... AND d_n => B.
 *
 * while(true){
 *   Let e_i = next_sygus_enum();
 *   // add e_i to the pool
 *   pool(B) += e_i;
 *   // try to construct a solution based on the pool
 *   Let D = {}.
 *   while
 *     D[v] is true for some v in pts(B), and
 *     d'[v] is false for some d' in pool(B) and
 *     no element of cores(B) is a subset of D ++ { d' }
 *   {
 *     D += { d' }
 *     if D is false for all v in pts(B)
 *       if (S ^ D) => B
 *         Let U be a subset of D such that S ^ U ^ ~B is unsat.
 *         if S ^ U is unsat
 *           Let W be a subset of D such that S ^ W is unsat.
 *             cores(B) += W
 *             remove some d'' in W from D
 *         else
 *           return u_1 AND ... AND u_m where U = { u_1, ..., u_m }
 *       else
 *         pts(B) += { v } where { x -> v } is a model for D ^ ~B
 *   }
 * }
