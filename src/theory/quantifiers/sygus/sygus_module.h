/** SygusModule
 *
 * This is the base class of sygus modules, owned by SynthConjecture. The
 * purpose of this class is to, when applicable, suggest candidate solutions for
 * SynthConjecture to test.
 *
 * In more detail, an instance of the conjecture class (SynthConjecture) creates
 * the negated deep embedding form of the synthesis conjecture. In the
 * following, assume this is:
 *   forall d. exists x. P( d, x )
 * where d are of sygus datatype type. The "base instantiation" of this
 * conjecture (see SynthConjecture::d_base_inst) is the formula:
 *   exists y. P( k, y )
 * where k are the "candidate" variables for the conjecture.
 *
 * Modules implement an initialize function, which determines whether the module
 * will take responsibility for the given conjecture.
