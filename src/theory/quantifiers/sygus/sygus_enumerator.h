/** SygusEnumerator
 *
 * This class is used for enumerating all terms of a sygus datatype type. At
 * a high level, it is used as an alternative approach to sygus datatypes
 * solver as a candidate generator in a synthesis loop. It filters terms based
 * on redundancy criteria, for instance, it does not generate two terms whose
 * builtin terms (TermDb::sygusToBuiltin) can be shown to be equivalent via
 * rewriting. It enumerates terms in order of sygus term size
 * (TermDb::getSygusTermSize).
 *
 * It also can be configured to enumerates sygus terms with free variables,
 * (as opposed to variables bound in the formal arguments list of the
 * function-to-synthesize), where each free variable appears in exactly one
 * subterm. For grammar:
 *   S -> 0 | 1 | x | S+S
 * this enumerator will generate the stream:
 *   z1, C_0, C_1, C_x, C_+(z1, z2), C_+(z1, C_1), C_+(C_1, C_1) ...
 * and so on, where z1 and z2 are variables of sygus datatype type S. We call
 * these "shapes". This feature can be enabled by setting enumShapes to true
 * in the constructor below.

  /** Term cache
   *
   * This stores a list of terms for a given sygus type. The key features of
   * this data structure are that terms are stored in order of size,
   * indices can be recorded that indicate where terms of size n begin for each
   * natural number n, and redundancy criteria are used for discarding terms
   * that are not relevant. This includes discarding terms whose builtin version
   * is the same up to T-rewriting with another, or is equivalent under
   * examples, if the conjecture in question is in examples form and
   * sygusSymBreakPbe is enabled.
   *
   * This class also computes static information about sygus types that is
   * relevant for enumeration. Primarily, this includes mapping constructors
   * to "constructor classes". Two sygus constructors can be placed in the same
   * constructor class if their constructor weight is equal, and the tuple
   * of their argument types are the same. For example, for:
   *   A -> A+B | A-B | A*B | A+A | A | x
   * The first three constructors above can be placed in the same constructor
   * class, assuming they have identical weights. Constructor classes are used
   * as an optimization when enumerating terms, since they expect the same
   * tuple of argument terms for constructing a term of a fixed size.
   *
   * Constructor classes are allocated such that the constructor weights are
   * in ascending order. This allows us to avoid constructors whose weight
   * is greater than n while we are trying to enumerate terms of sizes strictly
   * less than n.
   *
   * Constructor class 0 is reserved for nullary operators with weight 0. This
   * is an optimization so that such constructors can be skipped for sizes
   * greater than 0, since we know all terms generated by these constructors
   * have size 0.

   *
   * To enumerate terms, this class performs the following steps as necessary
   * during a call to increment():
   * - Fix the size of terms "d_currSize" we are currently enumerating,
   * - Set the constructor class "d_consClassNum" whose constructors are the top
   * symbol of the current term we are constructing. All constructors from this
   * class have the same weight, which we store in d_ccWeight,
   * - Initialize the current children "d_children" so that the sum of their
   * current sizes is exactly (d_currSize - d_ccWeight),
   * - Increment the current set of children until a new tuple of terms is
   * considered,
   * - Set the constructor "d_consNum" from within the constructor class,
   * - Build the current term and check whether it is not redundant according
   * to the term cache of its type.
   *
   * We say this enumerator is active if initialize(...) returns true, and the
   * last call (if any) to increment returned true.
   *
   * This class maintains the following invariants, for tc=d_se->d_tcache[d_tn],
   * if it is active:
   * (1) getCurrent() is tc.getTerm(tc.getNumTerms()-1),
   * (2) tc.pushEnumSizeIndex() has been called by this class exactly
   * getCurrentSize() times.
   * In other words, (1) getCurrent() is always the last term in the term cache
   * of the type of this enumerator tc, and (2) the size counter of tc is in
   * sync with the current size of this enumerator, that is, the master
   * enumerator is responsible for communicating size boundaries to its term
   * cache.
