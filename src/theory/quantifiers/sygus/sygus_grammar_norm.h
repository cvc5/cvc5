/** Operator position trie class
 *
 * This data structure stores an unresolved type corresponding to the
 * normalization of a type. This unresolved type is indexed by the positions of
 * the construtors of the datatype associated with the original type. The list
 * of positions represent the operators, associated with the respective
 * considered constructors, that were used for building the unresolved type.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Let A be a type defined by the grammar "A -> x | 0 | 1 | A + A". In its
 * datatype representation the operator for "x" is in position 0, for "0" in
 * position "1" and so on. Consider entries (T, [op_1, ..., op_n]) -> T' to
 * represent that a type T is normalized with operators [op_1, ..., op_n] into
 * the type T'. For entries
 *
 * (A, [x, 0, 1, +]) -> A1
 * (A, [x, 1, +]) -> A2
 * (A, [1, +]) -> A3
 * (A, [0]) -> AZ
 * (A, [x]) -> AX
 * (A, [1]) -> AO
 *
 * the OpPosTrie T we build for this type is :
 *
 * T[A] :
 *      T[A].d_children[0] : AX
 *        T[A].d_children[0].d_children[1] :
 *          T[A].d_children[0].d_children[1].d_children[2] :
 *            T[A].d_children[0].d_children[1].d_children[2].d_children[3] : A1
 *        T[A].d_children[0].d_children[2] :
 *          T[A].d_children[0].d_children[2].d_children[3] : A2
 *      T[A].d_children[1] : AZ
 *      T[A].d_children[2] : AO
 *        T[A].d_children[2].d_children[4] : A3
 *
 * Nodes store the types built for the path of positions up to that point, if
 * any.

 * Int -> x | y | Int + Int | 0 | 1 | ite(Bool, Int, Int)
