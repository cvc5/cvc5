/** IMGenerator class
 *
 * Virtual base class for generating InstMatch objects, which correspond to
 * quantifier instantiations. The main use of this class is as a backend utility
 * to Trigger (see theory/quantifiers/ematching/trigger.h).
 *
 * Some functions below take as argument a pointer to the current quantifiers
 * engine, which is used for making various queries about what terms and
 * equalities exist in the current context.
 *
 * Some functions below take a pointer to a parent Trigger object, which is used
 * to post-process and finalize the instantiations through
 * sendInstantiation(...), where the parent trigger will make calls to
 * Instantiate::addInstantiation(...). The latter function is the entry
 * point in which instantiate lemmas are enqueued to be sent on the output
 * channel.
