/** A collection of nodes representing a trigger.
 *
 * This class encapsulates all implementations of E-matching in cvc5.
 * Its primary use is as a utility of the quantifiers module InstantiationEngine
 * (see theory/quantifiers/ematching/instantiation_engine.h) which uses Trigger
 * to make appropriate calls to Instantiate::addInstantiation(...) (see
 * theory/instantiate.h) for the instantiate utility of the quantifiers engine
 * (d_quantEngine) associated with this trigger.  These calls queue
 * instantiation lemmas to the output channel of TheoryQuantifiers during a full
 * effort check.
 *
 * Concretely, a Trigger* t is used in the following way during a full effort
 * check. Assume that t is associated with quantified formula q (see field d_f).
 * We call :
 *
 * // setup initial information
 * t->resetInstantiationRound();
 * // will produce instantiations based on matching with all terms
 * t->reset( Node::null() );
 * // add all instantiations based on E-matching with this trigger and the
 * // current context
 * t->addInstantiations();
 *
 * This will result in (a set of) calls to
 * Instantiate::addInstantiation(q, m1)...Instantiate::addInstantiation(q, mn),
 * where m1...mn are InstMatch objects. These calls add the corresponding
 * instantiation lemma for (q,mi) on the output channel associated with
 * d_quantEngine.
 *
 * The Trigger class is wrapper around an underlying IMGenerator class, which
 * implements various forms of E-matching for its set of nodes (d_nodes), which
 * is refered to in the literature as a "trigger". A trigger is a set of terms
 * whose free variables are the bound variables of a quantified formula q,
 * and that is used to guide instantiations for q (for example, see "Efficient
 * E-Matching for SMT Solvers" by de Moura et al).
 *
 * For example of an instantiation lemma produced by E-matching :
 *
 * quantified formula : forall x. P( x )
 *            trigger : P( x )
 *     ground context : ~P( a )
 *
 * Then E-matching matches P( x ) and P( a ), resulting in the match { x -> a }
 * which is used to generate the instantiation lemma :
 *   (forall x. P( x )) => P( a )
 *
 * Terms that are provided as input to a Trigger class via mkTrigger
 * should be in "instantiation constant form", see
 * TermUtil::getInstConstantNode. Say we have quantified formula q whose AST is
 * the Node (FORALL (BOUND_VAR_LIST x) (NOT (P x)) (INST_PATTERN_LIST
 * (INST_PATTERN (P x)))) then TermUtil::getInstConstantNode( q, (P x) ) = (P
 * IC) where IC = TermUtil::getInstantiationConstant( q, i ). Trigger expects as
 * input (P IC) to represent the Trigger (P x). This form ensures that
 * references to bound variables are unique to quantified formulas, which is
 * required to ensure the correctness of instantiation lemmas we generate.
