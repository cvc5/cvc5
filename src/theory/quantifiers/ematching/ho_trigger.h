/** HigherOrder trigger
 *
 * This extends the trigger class with techniques that post-process
 * instantiations, specified by InstMatch objects, according to a variant of
 * Huet's algorithm. For details, see Chapter 16 of the Handbook of Automated
 * Reasoning (vol. 2), by Gilles Dowek.
 *
 * The main difference between HigherOrderTrigger and Trigger is the function
 * sendInstantiation(...). Recall that this function is called when its
 * underlying IMGenerator generates an InstMatch m using E-matching technique.
 * We enumerate additional instantiations based on m, when the domain of m
 * contains variables of function type.
 *
 * Examples below (f, x, y are universal variables):
 *
 * (EX1): (f x y) matches (k 0 1) in standard E-matching with:
 *
 * f -> k, x -> 0, y -> 1
 *
 * This match is extended to four possible solutions by this class:
 *
 * f -> \ xy. (k x y), x -> 0, y -> 1
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 y), x -> 0, y -> 1
 * f -> \ xy. (k x 1), x -> 0, y -> 1
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 1), x -> 0, y -> 1
 *
 *
 * (EX2): Similarly, (f x y) matches (k 0 0) with possible solutions:
 *
 * f -> \ xy. (k x x), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k y x), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 x), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k x y), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k y y), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 y), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k x 0), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k y 0), x -> 0, y -> 0
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 0), x -> 0, y -> 0
 *
 *
 * (EX3): (f x y), (f x z) simultaneously match (k 0 1), (k 0 2) with possible
 * solutions:
 *
 * f -> \ xy. (k x y), x -> 0, y -> 1, z -> 2
 * f -> \ xy. (k 0 y), x -> 0, y -> 1, z -> 2
 *
 *
 * This class enumerates the lists above until one instantiation of that form is
 * successfully added via a call to Instantiate::addInstantiation(...)
 *
 *
 * It also implements a way of forcing APPLY_UF to expand to curried HO_APPLY to
 * handle a corner case where there are no matchable ground terms
 * (addHoTypeMatchPredicateLemmas).
