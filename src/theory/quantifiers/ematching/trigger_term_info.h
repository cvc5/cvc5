/** Information about a node used in a trigger.
 *
 * This information includes:
 * 1. the free variables of the node, and
 * 2. information about which terms are useful for matching.
 *
 * As an example, consider the trigger
 *   { f( x ), g( y ), P( y, z ) }
 * for quantified formula
 *   forall xy. ( f( x ) != b => ( P( x, g( y ) ) V P( y, z ) ) )
 *
 * Notice that it is only useful to match f( x ) to f-applications not in the
 * equivalence class of b, and P( y, z ) to P-applications not in the
 * equivalence class of true, as such instances will always be entailed by the
 * ground equalities and disequalities the current context. Entailed instances
 * are typically not helpful, and are discarded in
 * Instantiate::addInstantiation(...) unless the option --no-inst-no-entail is
 * enabled. For more details, see page 10 of "Congruence Closure with Free
 * Variables", Barbosa et al., TACAS 2017.
