/** Enumerative instantiation
 *
 * This class implements enumerative instantiation described
 * in Reynolds et al., "Revisiting Enumerative Instantiation".
 *
 * It is an instance of QuantifiersModule, whose main
 * task is to make calls to QuantifiersEngine during
 * calls to QuantifiersModule::check(...).
 *
 * This class adds instantiations based on enumerating
 * well-typed terms that occur in the current context
 * based on a heuristically determined ordering on
 * tuples of terms. This ordering incorporates
 * reasoning about the relevant domain of quantified
 * formulas (see theory/quantifiers/relevant_domain.h).
 * We consider only ground terms that occur in the
 * context due to Theorem 1 of "Revisiting Enumerative
 * Instantiation". Notice this theorem holds only for theories
 * with compactness. For theories such as arithmetic,
 * this class may introduce "default" terms that are
 * used in instantiations, say 0 for arithmetic, even
 * when the term 0 does not occur in the context.
 *
 * This strategy is not enabled by default, and
 * is enabled by the option:
 *   --full-saturate-quant
 *
 * It is generally called with lower priority than
 * other instantiation strategies, although this
 * option interleaves it with other strategies
 * during quantifier effort level QEFFORT_STANDARD:
 *   --fs-interleave
