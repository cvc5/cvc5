 * - Loos/Weispfenning's method (virtual term substitution) for linear real
 *    arithmetic,
 * - Ferrante/Rackoff's method (interior points) for linear real arithmetic,
 * - Cooper's method for linear arithmetic.
 * For details, see Reynolds et al, "Solving Linear Arithmetic Using
 * Counterexample-Guided Instantiation", FMSD 2017.
 *
 * This class contains all necessary information for instantiating a single
 * real or integer typed variable of a single quantified formula.

   *   isLower = false, e^M = 0, t^M = 2, inf_coeff = 0, delta_coeff = 2

   * For example, if e has Int type and:
   *   isLower = true, e^M = 4, t^M = 2, theta = 3
   * Then, this function returns t+2, noting that (t+2)^M mod 3 = e^M mod 3 = 2.

   * For example, if e has Int type and:
