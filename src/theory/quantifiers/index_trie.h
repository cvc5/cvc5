/** Trie of  sequences indices, used to check for subsequence membership.
 *
 * The  data structure stores tuples of indices where some elements may be
 * left blank. The objective is to enable checking whether a given, completely
 * filled in, tuple has a  sub-tuple  present in the data structure.  This is
 * used in the term tuple enumeration (term_tuple_enumerator.cpp) to store
 * combinations of terms that had yielded a useless instantiation  and therefore
 * should not be repeated.  Hence, we are always assuming that all tuples have
 * the same number of elements.
 *
 * So for instance, if the data structure contains (_, 1, _, 3),  any  given
 * tuple that contains 1 and 3 on second and forth position, respectively, would
 * match.
 *
 *  The data structure behaves essentially as a traditional trie. Each tuple
 * is treated as a sequence of integers with a special symbol for blank, which
 * is in fact stored  in a special  child (member d_blank).  As a small
 * optimization, a suffix containing only blanks is represented by  the empty
 * subtree, i.e., a null pointer.
