/** QueryGeneratorSampleSat
 *
 * This module is used for finding satisfiable queries that are maximally
 * likely to trigger an unsound response in an SMT solver. These queries are
 * mined from a stream of enumerated expressions. We judge likelihood of
 * triggering unsoundness by the frequency at which the query is satisfied.
 *
 * In detail, given a stream of expressions t_1, ..., t_{n-1}, upon generating
 * term t_n, we consider a query (not) t_n = t_i to be an interesting query
 * if it is satisfied by at most D points, where D is a predefined threshold
 * given by the sygusQueryGenThresh option. If t_n has type Bool, we
 * additionally consider the case where t_n is satisfied (or not satisfied) by
 * fewer than D points.
 *
 * In addition to generating single literal queries, this module also generates
 * conjunctive queries, for instance, by remembering that literals L1 and L2
 * were both satisfied by the same point, and thus L1 ^ L2 is an interesting
 * query as well.
