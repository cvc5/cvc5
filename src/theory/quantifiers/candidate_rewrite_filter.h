/** candidate rewrite filter
 *
 * This class is responsible for various filtering techniques for candidate
 * rewrite rules, including:
 * (1) filtering based on variable ordering,
 * (2) filtering based on congruence,
 * (3) filtering based on matching.
 * For details, see Reynolds et al "Rewrites for SMT Solvers using Syntax-Guided
 * Enumeration", SMT 2018.
 *
 * In the following, we assume that the registerRelevantPair method of this
 * class been called for some pairs of terms. For each such call to
 * registerRelevantPair( t, s ), we say that (t,s) and (s,t) are "relevant
 * pairs". A relevant pair ( t, s ) typically corresponds to a (candidate)
 * rewrite t = s.

   * database utility class.
   *
   * If useSygusType is false, this means that the terms in filterPair and
   * registerRelevantPair calls should be interpreted as themselves. Otherwise,
   * if useSygusType is true, these terms should be interpreted as their
   * analog according to the deep embedding.

   *
   * This method returns true if the pair (n, eq_n) should be filtered. If it
   * is not filtered, then the caller may choose to call
   * registerRelevantPair(n, eq_n) below, although it may not, say if it finds
   * another reason to discard the pair.
   *
   * If this method returns false, then for all previous relevant pairs
   * ( a, eq_a ), we have that n = eq_n is not an instance of a = eq_a
   * modulo symmetry of equality, nor is n = eq_n derivable from the set of
   * all previous relevant pairs. The latter is determined by the d_drewrite
   * utility. For example:
   * [1]  ( t+0, t ) and ( x+0, x )
   * will not both be relevant pairs of this function since t+0=t is
   * an instance of x+0=x.
   * [2]  ( s, t ) and ( s+0, t+0 )
   * will not both be relevant pairs of this function since s+0=t+0 is
   * derivable from s=t.
   * These two criteria may be combined, for example:
   * [3] ( t+0, s ) is not a relevant pair if both ( x+0, x+s ) and ( t+s, s )
   * are relevant pairs, since t+0 is an instance of x+0 where
   * { x |-> t }, and x+s { x |-> t } = s is derivable, via the third pair
   * above (t+s = s).
