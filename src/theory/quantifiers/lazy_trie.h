/** LazyTrie
 *
 * This is a trie where terms are added in a lazy fashion. This data structure
 * is useful, for instance, when we are only interested in when two terms
 * map to the same node in the trie but we need not care about computing
 * exactly where they are.
 *
 * In other words, when a term n is added to this trie, we do not insist
 * that n is placed at the maximal depth of the trie. Instead, we place n at a
 * minimal depth node that has no children. In this case we say n is partially
 * evaluated in this trie.
 *
 * This class relies on an abstract evaluator interface above, which evaluates
 * nodes for indices.
 *
 * For example, say we have terms a, b, c and an evaluator ev where:
 *   ev->evaluate( a, 0,1,2 ) = 0, 5, 6
 *   ev->evaluate( b, 0,1,2 ) = 1, 3, 0
 *   ev->evaluate( c, 0,1,2 ) = 1, 3, 2
 * After adding a to the trie, we get:
 *   root: a
 * After adding b to the resulting trie, we get:
 *   root: null
 *     d_children[0]: a
 *     d_children[1]: b
 * After adding c to the resulting trie, we get:
 *   root: null
 *     d_children[0]: a
 *     d_children[1]: null
 *       d_children[3]: null
 *         d_children[0] : b
 *         d_children[2] : c
 * Notice that we need not call ev->evalute( a, 1 ) and ev->evalute( a, 2 ).

   * For example in the following trie with three classifiers:
   *
   *   root: null

   *       d_children[3]: null

   * to which we add a fourth classifier C such that C(b) = 0, C(c) = 1, C(d) =
   * 1 we have the resulting trie:
   *
   *   root: null
   *     d_children[0]: a -> {a}
   *     d_children[1]: null
   *       d_children[3]: null

   * ntotal is the number of classifiers before the addition of the new one. In
