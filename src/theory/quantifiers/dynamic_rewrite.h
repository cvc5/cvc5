/** DynamicRewriter
 *
 * This class is given a stream of equalities in calls to addRewrite(...).
 * The goal is to show that a subset of these can be inferred from previously
 * asserted equalities.  For example, a possible set of return values for
 * add rewrite on successive calls is the following:
 *
 *   addRewrite( x, y ) ---> true
 *   addRewrite( f( x ), f( y ) ) ---> false, since we already know x=y
 *   addRewrite( x, z ) ---> true
 *   addRewrite( x+y, x+z ) ---> false, since we already know y=x=z.
 *
 * This class can be used to filter out redundant candidate rewrite rules
 * when using the option sygusRewSynth().
 *
 * Currently, this class infers that an equality is redundant using
 * an instance of the equality engine that does congruence over all
 * operators by mapping all operators to uninterpreted ones and doing
 * congruence on APPLY_UF.
 *
 * TODO (#1591): Add more advanced technique, e.g. by theory rewriting
 * to show when terms can already be inferred equal.
