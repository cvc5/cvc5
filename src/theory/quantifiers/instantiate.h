 *

 * { x -> t } is the formula:

 *
 * Its main interface is ::addInstantiation(...), which is called by many of
 * the quantifiers modules, which enqueues instantiation lemmas in quantifiers
 * engine via calls to QuantifiersInferenceManager::addPendingLemma.
 *
 * It also has utilities for constructing instantiations, and interfaces for
 * getting the results of the instantiations produced during check-sat calls.
