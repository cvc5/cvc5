/** Term Database
 *
 * This class is a key utility used by
 * a number of approaches for quantifier instantiation,
 * including E-matching, conflict-based instantiation,
 * and model-based instantiation.
 *
 * The primary responsibilities for this class are to :
 * (1) Maintain a list of all ground terms that exist in the quantifier-free
 *     solvers, as notified through the master equality engine.
 * (2) Build TNodeTrie objects that index all ground terms, per operator.
 *
 * Like other utilities, its reset(...) function is called
 * at the beginning of full or last call effort checks.
 * This initializes the database for the round. However,
 * notice that TNodeTrie objects are computed
 * lazily for performance reasons.
