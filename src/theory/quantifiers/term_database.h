/** Term Database
 *
 * This class is a key utility used by
 * a number of approaches for quantifier instantiation,
 * including E-matching, conflict-based instantiation,
 * and model-based instantiation.
 *
 * The primary responsibilities for this class are to :
 * (1) Maintain a list of all ground terms that exist in the quantifier-free
 *     solvers, as notified through the master equality engine.
 * (2) Build TNodeTrie objects that index all ground terms, per operator.
 *
 * Like other utilities, its reset(...) function is called
 * at the beginning of full or last call effort checks.
 * This initializes the database for the round. However,
 * notice that TNodeTrie objects are computed
 * lazily for performance reasons.

   * With the standard registration in addTerm, we construct term indices for

   * However, to match (g x) with (@ (@ f 0) 1), we require that

   * is an entry in the term index of g. To do this, we maintain a term
   * index for a fresh variable pfun, the purification variable for
   * (@ f 0). Thus, we register the term (pfun 1) in the call to this function
   * for (@ (@ f 0) 1). This ensures that, when processing the equality
   * (@ f 0) = g, we merge the term indices of g and pfun. Hence, the entry
   *   [1] -> (@ (@ f 0) 1)
   * is added to the term index of g, assuming g is the representative of
   * the equivalence class of g and pfun.

   * Above, we set d_ho_fun_op_purify[(@ f 0)] = pfun, and
