 ** \brief Extended theory interface.
 **
 ** This implements a generic module, used by theory solvers, for performing
 ** "context-dependent simplification", as described in Reynolds et al
 ** "Designing Theory Solvers with Extensions", FroCoS 2017.
 **
 ** At a high level, this technique implements a generic inference scheme based
 ** on the combination of SAT-context-dependent equality reasoning and
 ** SAT-context-indepedent rewriting.
 **
 ** As a simple example, say
 ** (1) TheoryStrings tells us that the following facts hold in the SAT context:
 **     x = "A" ^ str.contains( str.++( x, z ), "B" ) = true.
 ** (2) The Rewriter tells us that:
 **     str.contains( str.++( "A", z ), "B" ) ----> str.contains( z, "B" ).
 ** From this, this class may infer that the following lemma is T-valid:
 **   x = "A" ^ str.contains( str.++( x, z ), "B" ) => str.contains( z, "B" )

 * It maintains:
 * (1) A set of "extended function" kinds (d_extf_kind),
 * (2) A database of active/inactive extended function terms (d_ext_func_terms)
 * that have been registered to the class.

 * This class has methods doInferences/doReductions, which send out lemmas
 * based on the current set of active extended function terms. The former
 * is based on context-dependent simplification, where this class asks the
 * underlying theory for a "derivable substitution", whereby extended functions
 * may be reducable.
