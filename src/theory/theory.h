/**
 * Base class for T-solvers.  Abstract DPLL(T).
 *
 * This is essentially an interface class.  The TheoryEngine has
 * pointers to Theory.  Note that only one specific Theory type (e.g.,
 * TheoryUF) can exist per NodeManager, because of how the
 * RegisteredAttr works.  (If you need multiple instances of the same
 * theory, you'll have to write a multiplexed theory that dispatches
 * all calls to them.)
 *
 * NOTE: A Theory has a special way of being initialized. The owner of a Theory
 * is either:
 *
 * (A) Using Theory as a standalone object, not associated with a TheoryEngine.
 * In this case, simply call the public initialization method
 * (Theory::finishInitStandalone).
 *
 * (B) TheoryEngine, which determines how the Theory acts in accordance with
 * its theory combination policy. We require the following steps in order:
 * (B.1) Get information about whether the theory wishes to use an equality
 * eninge, and more specifically which equality engine notifications the Theory
 * would like to be notified of (Theory::needsEqualityEngine).
 * (B.2) Set the equality engine of the theory (Theory::setEqualityEngine),
 * which we refer to as the "official equality engine" of this Theory. The
 * equality engine passed to the theory must respect the contract(s) specified
 * by the equality engine setup information (EeSetupInfo) returned in the
 * previous step.
 * (B.3) Set the other required utilities including setQuantifiersEngine and
 * setDecisionManager.
 * (B.4) Call the private initialization method (Theory::finishInit).
 *
 * Initialization of the second form happens during TheoryEngine::finishInit,
 * after the quantifiers engine and model objects have been set up.
