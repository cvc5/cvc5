/**
 * This implements model-based theory combination. In this approach, we invoke
 * the standard model construction and afterwards check which terms have become
 * congruent. Note that since the model equality engine does *not* do
 * congruence, we compute this manually in the combineTheories method.
 * For each pair of congruent terms, we split on each pair of arguments that
 * are not already made equal in the theory that owns the congruent terms.
 *
 * For example, say f : Int -> Int and the initial model set
 * (f a) = 3, (f (+ b 1)) = 4. If we chose a = 2, b = 1, then
 * (1) a = (+ b 1) = 2
 * (2) (f 2) is set to both 3 and 4.
 * It should be the case that some argument of these two applications of f
 * are both shared terms, in this case a and b+1, in which case we add the
 * split a = b+1.
 *
 * Note that in the above case we had two applications of f that were congruent
 * *and* disequal. Note that terms that are congruent and equal also must be
 * treated similarly, as identifying them may violate theory constraints.
 * For example say c : Int -> D is a constructor of datatype D.
 * Say (c a) != (c (+ b 1)) is a constraint belonging to the theory of
 * datatypes, which is *not* communicated to the model. In this case, if the
 * model sets a = 2, b = 1, then (c a) = (c (+ b 1)) = (c 2),
 * i.e. they are congruent and equal, we split must split on a = b+1.
 *
 * It is important that this class check for splits for all cases of the above
 * form at once, as in practice there are many possible splits that should be
 * sent all at once, instead of considering one at a time.
