  /** simple regular expression consume
   *
   * This method is called when we are rewriting a membership of the form
   *   s1 ++ ... ++ sn in r1 ++ ... ++ rm
   * We have that mchildren consists of the strings s1...sn, and children
   * consists of the regular expressions r1...rm.
   *
   * This method tries to strip off parts of the concatenation terms. It updates
   * the vectors such that the resulting vectors are such that the membership
   * mchildren[n'...n''] in children[m'...m''] is equivalent to the input
   * membership. The argument dir indicates the direction to consider, where
   * 0 means strip off the front, 1 off the back, and < 0 off of both.
   *
   * If this method returns the false node, then we have inferred that no
   * string in the language of r1 ++ ... ++ rm is a prefix (when dir!=1) or
   * suffix (when dir!=0) of s1 ++ ... ++ sn. Otherwise, it returns the null
   * node.
   *
   * For example, given input
   *   mchildren = { "ab", x }, children = { [["a"]], ([["cd"]])* } and dir = 0,
   * this method updates:
   *   mchildren = { "b", x }, children = { ("cd")* }
   * and returns null.
   *
   * For example, given input
   *   { x, "abb", x }, { [[x]], ["a"..."b"], allchar, [[y]], [[x]]} and dir=-1,
   * this method updates:
   *   { "b" }, { [[y]] }
   * where [[.]] denotes str.to.re, and returns null.
   *
   * Notice that the above requirement for returning false is stronger than
   * determining that s1 ++ ... ++ sn in r1 ++ ... ++ rm is equivalent to false.
   * For example, for input "bb" in "b" ++ ( "a" )*, we do not return false
   * since "b" is in the language of "b" ++ ( "a" )* and is a prefix of "bb".
   * We do not return false even though the above membership is equivalent
   * to false. We do this because the function is used e.g. to test whether a
   * possible unrolling leads to a conflict. This is demonstrated by the
   * following examples:
   *
   * For example, given input
   *   { "bb", x }, { "b", ("a")* } and dir=-1,
   * this method updates:
   *   { "b" }, { ("a")* }
   * and returns null.
   *
   * For example, given input
   *   { "cb", x }, { "b", ("a")* } and dir=-1,
   * this method leaves children and mchildren unchanged and returns false.
   *
   * Notice that based on this, we can determine that:
   *   "cb" ++ x  in ( "b" ++ ("a")* )*
   * is equivalent to false, whereas we cannot determine that:
   *   "bb" ++ x  in ( "b" ++ ("a")* )*
   * is equivalent to false.
