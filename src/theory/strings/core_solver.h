  /** check flat forms
   *
   * This applies an inference schema based on "flat forms". The flat form of a
   * string term t is a vector of representative terms [r1, ..., rn] such that
   * t is of the form t1 ++ ... ++ tm and r1 ++ ... ++ rn is equivalent to
   * rewrite( [t1] ++ ... ++ [tm] ), where [t1] denotes the representative of
   * the equivalence class containing t1. For example, if t is y ++ z ++ z,
   * E is { y = "", w = z }, and w is the representative of the equivalence
   * class { w, z }, then the flat form of t is [w, w]. Say t1 and t2 are terms
   * in the same equivalence classes with flat forms [r1...rn] and [s1...sm].
   * We may infer various facts based on this pair of terms. For example:
   *   ri = si, if ri != si, rj == sj for each j < i, and len(ri)=len(si),
   *   rn = sn, if n=m and rj == sj for each j < n,
   *   ri = empty, if n=m+1 and ri == rj for each i=1,...,m.
   * We refer to these as "unify", "endpoint-eq" and "endpoint-emp" inferences
   * respectively.
   *
   * Notice that this inference scheme is an optimization and not needed for
   * model-soundness. The motivation for this schema is that it is simpler than
   * checkNormalFormsEq, which can be seen as a recursive version of this
   * schema (see difference of "normal form" vs "flat form" below), and
   * checkNormalFormsEq is complete, in the sense that if it passes with no
   * inferences, we are ensured that all string equalities in the current
   * context are satisfied.
   *
   * Must call checkCycles before this function in a strategy.
   */
  void checkFlatForms();
  /** check normal forms equalities
   *
   * This applies an inference schema based on "normal forms". The normal form
   * of an equivalence class of string terms e = {t1, ..., tn} union {x1....xn},
   * where t1...tn are concatenation terms is a vector of representative terms
   * [r1, ..., rm] such that:
   * (1) if n=0, then m=1 and r1 is the representative of e,
   * (2) if n>0, say
   *   t1 = t^1_1 ++ ... ++ t^1_m_1
   *   ...
   *   tn = t^1_n ++ ... ++ t^_m_n
   * for *each* i=1, ..., n, the result of concenating the normal forms of
   * t^1_1 ++ ... ++ t^1_m_1 is equal to [r1, ..., rm]. If an equivalence class
   * can be assigned a normal form, then all equalities between ti and tj are
   * satisfied by all models that correspond to extensions of the current
   * assignment. For further detail on this terminology, see Liang et al
   * CAV 2014.
   *
   * Notice that all constant words are implicitly considered concatentation
   * of their characters, e.g. "abc" is treated as "a" ++ "b" ++ "c".
   *
   * At a high level, we build normal forms for equivalence classes bottom-up,
   * starting with equivalence classes that are minimal with respect to the
   * containment ordering < computed during checkCycles. While computing a
   * normal form for an equivalence class, we may infer equalities between
   * components of strings that must be equal (e.g. x=y when x++z == y++w when
   * len(x)==len(y) is asserted), derive conflicts if two strings have disequal
   * prefixes/suffixes (e.g. "a" ++ x == "b" ++ y is a conflict), or split
   * string terms into smaller components using fresh skolem variables (see
   * Inference values with names "SPLIT"). We also may introduce regular
   * expression constraints in this method for looping word equations (see
   * the Inference INFER_FLOOP).
   *
   * If this inference schema returns no facts, lemmas, or conflicts, then
   * we have successfully assigned normal forms for all equivalence classes, as
   * stored in d_normal_forms. Otherwise, this method may add a fact, lemma, or
   * conflict based on inferences in the Inference enumeration above.
   */
  void checkNormalFormsEq();
  /** check normal forms disequalities
   *
   * This inference schema can be seen as the converse of the above schema. In
   * particular, it ensures that each pair of distinct equivalence classes
   * e1 and e2 have distinct normal forms.
   *
   * This method considers all pairs of distinct equivalence classes (e1,e2)
   * such that len(x1)==len(x2) is asserted for some x1 in e1 and x2 in e2. It
   * then traverses the normal forms of x1 and x2, say they are [r1, ..., rn]
   * and [s1, ..., sm]. For the minimial i such that ri!=si, if ri and si are
   * disequal and have the same length, then x1 and x2 have distinct normal
   * forms. Otherwise, we may add splitting lemmas on the length of ri and si,
   * or split on an equality between ri and si.
   *
   * If this inference schema returns no facts, lemmas, or conflicts, then all
   * disequalities between string terms are satisfied by all models that are
   * extensions of the current assignment.
