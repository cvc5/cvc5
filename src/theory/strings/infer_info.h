/**
 * An inference. This is a class to track an unprocessed call to either
 * send a fact, lemma, or conflict that is waiting to be asserted to the
 * equality engine or sent on the output channel.
 *
 * For the sake of proofs, the premises in InferInfo have a particular
 * ordering for many of the core strings rules, which is expected by
 * InferProofCons for constructing proofs of F_CONST, F_UNIFY, N_CONST, etc.
 * which apply to a pair of string terms t and s. At a high level, the ordering
 * expected in d_ant is:
 * (1) (multiple) literals that explain why t and s have the same prefix/suffix,
 * (2) t = s,
 * (3) (optionally) a length constraint.
 * For example, say we have:
 *   { x ++ y ++ v1 = z ++ w ++ v2, x = z ++ u, u = "", len(y) = len(w) }
 * We can conclude y = w by the N_UNIFY rule from the left side. The premise
 * has the following form:
 * - (prefix up to y/w equal) x = z ++ u, u = "",
 * - (main equality) x ++ y ++ v1 = z ++ w ++ v2,
 * - (length constraint) len(y) = len(w).
