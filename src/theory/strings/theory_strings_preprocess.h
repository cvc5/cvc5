  /** The reduce routine
   *
   * This is the main routine for constructing the reduction lemma for
   * an extended function t. It returns the simplified form of t, as well
   * as assertions for t, interpeted conjunctively.  The reduction lemma
   * for t is:
   *   asserts[0] ^ ... ^ asserts[n] ^ t = t'
   * where t' is the term returned by this method.
   * The argument sc defines the methods for generating new Skolem variables.
   * The return value is t itself if it is not reduced by this class.
   *
   * The reduction lemma for t is a way of specifying the complete semantics
   * of t. In other words, any model satisfying the reduction lemma of t
   * correctly interprets t.
   *
   * @param t The node to reduce,
   * @param asserts The vector for storing the assertions that correspond to
   * the reduction of t,
   * @param sc The skolem cache for generating new variables,
   * @return The reduced form of t.
