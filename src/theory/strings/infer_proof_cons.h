   * Purify core substitution.
   *
   * When reconstructing proofs for the core strings calculus, we rely on
   * sequential substitutions for constructing proofs involving recursive
   * computation of normal forms. However, this can be incorrect in cases where
   * a term like (str.replace x a b) is being treated as an atomic term,
   * and a substitution applied over (str.replace x a b) -> c, x -> d.
   * This can lead to the term (str.replace d a b) being generated instead of
   * c.
   *
   * As an example of this method, given input:
   *   tgt = (= x (str.++ (f x) c))
   *   children = { (= (f x) a), (= x (str.++ b (f x))) }
   *   concludeTgtNew = true
   * This method updates:
   *   tgt = (= x (str.++ k c))
   *   children = { (= k a), (= x (str.++ b k)) }
   * where k is the purification skolem for (f x). Additionally, it ensures
   * that psb has a proof of:
   *   (= x (str.++ k c)) from (= x (str.++ (f x) c))
   *      ...note the direction, since concludeTgtNew = true
   *   (= k a) from (= (f x) a)
   *   (= x (str.++ b k)) from (= x (str.++ b (f x)))
   * Notice that the resulting substitution can now be safely used as a
   * sequential substution, since (f x) has been purified with k. The proofs
   * in psb ensure that a proof step involving the purified substitution will
   * have the same net effect as a proof step using the original substitution.
   *
   * The argument pt determines which arguments are relevant for purification.
   * For core calculus (CORE_EQ) rules, examples of relevant positions are
   * non-concatenation terms in positions like:
   *   (= * (str.++ * (str.++ * *) * *))
   *   (not (= (str.++ * *) *))
   * For extended function simplification, examples of relevant positions are:
   *   (= (str.replace * * *) "")
   *   (str.contains * *)
   * If we are purifying a substitution with equality, the LHS is a relevant
   * position to purify, and the RHS is treated like CORE_EQ.
   *
   * For example, given substitution (= t ""), an example
   * inference in the core calculus is:
   *   (= (str.++ t "A") (str.++ "B" u)) => false
   * An example of an extended function inference is:
   *   (= (str.replace (str.substr t 0 2) t "C") (str.++ "C" f[t]))
   * Note for the latter, we do not apply the substitution to
   * (str.substr t 0 2).
   *
   * @param pt Determines the positions that are relevant for purification.
   * @param tgt The term we were originally going to apply the substitution to.
   * @param children The premises corresponding to the substitution.
   * @param psb The proof step buffer
   * @param concludeTgtNew Whether we require proving the purified form of
   * tgt from tgt or vice versa.
   * @return true if we successfully purified the substitution and the target
   * term. Additionally, if successful, we ensure psb contains proofs of
   * children'[i] from children[i] for all i, and tgt' from tgt (or vice versa
   * based on concludeTgtNew).
