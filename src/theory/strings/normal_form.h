/** normal forms
 *
 * Stores information regarding the "normal form" of terms t in the current
 * context. Normal forms can be associated with terms, or with string
 * equivalence classes. For the latter, the normal form of an equivalence class
 * exists if exactly one unique normal form is associated to a subset of its
 * terms.
 *
 * In the following we use example where assertions are:
 *   { x = y, y = z, y = u ++ v, u = u1 ++ u2 }
 * and equivalence class [x] = { x, y, z, u ++ v }, whose normal form is
 *   (u1, u2, v)

  /**
   * Map from literals in the vector d_exp to integers indicating indices in
   * d_nf for which that literal L is relevant for explaining d_base = d_nf.
   *
   * In particular:
   * - false maps to an (ideally maximal) index relative to the start of d_nf
   * such that L is required for explaining why d_base has a prefix that
   * includes the term at that index,
   * - true maps to an (ideally maximal) index relative to the end of d_nf
   * such that L is required for explaining why d_base has a suffix that
   * includes the term at that index.
   * We call these the forward and backwards dependency indices.
   *
   * In the above example:
   *   y = u ++ v   : false -> 0, true -> 0
   *   u = u1 ++ u2 : false -> 0, true -> 1
   * When explaining y = u1 ++ u2 ++ v, the equality y = u ++ v is required
   * for explaining any prefix/suffix of y and its normal form. More
   * interestingly, the equality u = u1 ++ u2 is not required for explaining
   * that v is a suffix of y, since its reverse index in this map is 1,
   * indicating that "u2" is the first position in u1 ++ u2 ++ v that it is
   * required for explaining.
   *
   * This information is used to minimize explanations when conflicts arise,
   * thereby strengthening conflict clauses and lemmas.
   *
   * For example, say u ++ v = y = x = u ++ w and w and v are distinct
   * constants, using this dependency information, we could construct a
   * conflict:
   *   x = y ^ y = u ++ v ^ x = u ++ w
   * that does not include u = u1 ++ u2, because the conflict only pertains
   * to the last position in the normal form of y.
