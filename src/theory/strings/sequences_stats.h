/**
 * Statistics for the theory of strings.
 *
 * This is roughly broken up into the following parts:
 * (1) Inferences,
 * (2) Conflicts,
 * (3) Lemmas.
 *
 * "Inferences" (1) are steps invoked during solving, which either trigger:
 * (a) An internal update to the state of the solver (e.g. adding an inferred
 * equality to the equality engine),
 * (b) A call to OutputChannel::conflict,
 * (c) A call to OutputChannel::lemma.
 * For details, see InferenceManager. We track stats on each kind of
 * inference that have been indicated by the solvers in TheoryStrings.
 * Some kinds of inferences are further distinguished by the Kind of the node
 * they operate on (see d_cdSimplifications, d_reductions, d_regexpUnfoldings).
 *
 * "Conflicts" (2) arise from various kinds of reasoning, listed below,
 * where inferences are one of the possible methods for deriving conflicts.
