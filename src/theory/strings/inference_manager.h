/** Inference Manager
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to process inference steps for strategies
 * in the theory of strings.
 *
 * In particular, inferences are given to this class via calls to functions:
 *
 * sendInternalInference, sendInference, sendSplit
 *
 * This class decides how the conclusion of these calls will be processed.
 * It primarily has to decide whether the conclusions will be processed:
 *
 * (1) Internally in the strings solver, via calls to equality engine's
 * assertLiteral and assertPredicate commands. We refer to these literals as
 * "facts",
 * (2) Externally on the output channel of theory of strings as "lemmas",
 * (3) External on the output channel as "conflicts" (when a conclusion of an
 * inference is false).
 *
 * It buffers facts and lemmas in vectors d_pending and d_pending_lem
 * respectively.
 *
 * When applicable, facts can be flushed to the equality engine via a call to
 * doPendingFacts, and lemmas can be flushed to the output channel via a call
 * to doPendingLemmas.
 *
 * It also manages other kinds of interaction with the output channel of the
 * theory of strings, e.g. sendPhaseRequirement, setIncomplete, and
 * with the extended theory object e.g. markCongruent.

   * This function should be called when exp => eq. The set exp
   * contains literals that are explainable, i.e. those that hold in the
   * equality engine of the theory of strings. On the other hand, the set
   * noExplain contains nodes that are not explainable by the theory of strings.
   * This method may call sendLemma or otherwise add a InferInfo to d_pending,
   * indicating a fact should be asserted to the equality engine. Overall, the
   * result of this method is one of the following:
   *
   * [1] (No-op) Do nothing if eq is equivalent to true,
   *
   * [2] (Infer) Indicate that eq should be added to the equality engine of this
   * class with explanation exp, where exp is a set of literals that currently
   * hold in the equality engine. We add this to the pending vector d_pending.
   *
   * [3] (Lemma) Indicate that the lemma
   *   ( EXPLAIN(exp \ noExplain) ^ noExplain ) => eq
   * should be sent on the output channel of the theory of strings, where
   * EXPLAIN returns the explanation of the node in exp in terms of the literals
   * asserted to the theory of strings, as computed by the equality engine.
   * This is also added to a pending vector, d_pendingLem.
   *
   * [4] (Conflict) Immediately report a conflict EXPLAIN(exp) on the output
   * channel of the theory of strings.
   *
   * Determining which case to apply depends on the form of eq and whether
   * noExplain is empty. In particular, lemmas must be used whenever noExplain
   * is non-empty, conflicts are used when noExplain is empty and eq is false.
   *
   * @param exp The explanation of eq.
   * @param noExplain The subset of exp that cannot be explained by the
   * equality engine. This may impact whether we are processing this call as a
   * fact or as a lemma.
   * @param eq The conclusion.
   * @param infer Identifies the reason for inference, used for
   * debugging. This updates the statistics about the number of inferences made
   * of each type.
   * @param isRev Whether this is the "reverse variant" of the inference, which
   * is used as a hint for proof reconstruction.
   * @param asLemma If true, then this method will send a lemma instead
   * of a fact whenever applicable.
   * @return true if the inference was not trivial (e.g. its conclusion did
   * not rewrite to true).
