 * Intermediate representation for a sum of terms, mapping monomials to their
 * multiplicities. A sum implicitly represents the expression
 *   SUM(s.second * s.first for s in sum)
 * Using a map allows to easily check whether a monomial is already present and
 * then merge two terms (i.e. add their multiplicities). We use a std::map with
 * a proper comparator (instead of std::unordered_map) to allow easy
 * identification of the leading term. As we need to sort the terms anyway when
 * constructing a node, a std::unordered_map may only be faster if we experience
 * a lot of nullification (and thus paying the logarithmic overhead when working
 * with the map, but not having it when sorting in the end). Usually, though,
 * this saves us additional memory allocations for sorting the terms as it is
 * done in-place instead of copying the result out of the std::unordered_map
 * into a sortable container.

 * The method maintains a `sum` as a mapping from Node to RealAlgebraicNumber.
 * The nodes can be understood as monomials, or generally non-value parts of
 * the product, while the real algebraic numbers are the multiplicities of these
 * monomials or products. This allows to combine summands with identical
