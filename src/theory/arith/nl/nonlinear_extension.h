 * - "Invariant Checking of NRA Transition Systems
 * via Incremental Reduction to LRA with EUF" by
 * Cimatti et al., TACAS 2017.
 *
 * - Section 5 of "Desiging Theory Solvers with

 *
 * - "Satisfiability Modulo Transcendental
 * Functions via Incremental Linearization" by Cimatti
 * et al., CADE 2017.
 *
 * It's main functionality is a check(...) method,
 * which is called by TheoryArithPrivate either:
 * (1) at full effort with no conflicts or lemmas emitted, or
 * (2) at last call effort.
 * In this method, this class calls d_im.lemma(...)
 * for valid arithmetic theory lemmas, based on the current set of assertions,
 * where d_im is the inference manager of TheoryArith.
