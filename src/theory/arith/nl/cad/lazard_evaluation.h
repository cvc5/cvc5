/**
 * This class does the heavy lifting for the modified lifting procedure that is
 * required for Lazard's projection.
 *
 * Let p \in Q[x_0, ..., x_n] a multivariate polynomial whose roots we want to
 * isolate over the partial sample point A = [x_0 = a_0, ... x_{n-1} = a_{n-1}]
 * where a_0, ... a_{n-1} are real algebraic numbers and x_n is the last free
 * variable.
 *
 * The modified lifting procedure conceptually works as follows:
 *
 * for (x = a) in A:
 *    while p[x // a] = 0:
 *       p = p / (x - a)
 *    p = p[x // a]
 * return roots(p)
 *
 * As the assignment contains real algebraic numbers, though, we can not do any
 * of the computations directly, as our polynomials only support coefficients
 * from Z or Q, but not extensions (in the algebraic sense) thereof.
 *
 * Our approach is as follows:
 * Let pk be the minimal polynomial for a_k.
 * Instead of substituting p[x_k // a_k] we (canonically) embed p into the
 * quotient ring Q[x_k]/<p_k> and recursively build a tower of such quotient
 * rings that is isomorphic to nesting the corresponding field extensions
 * Q(a_1)(a_2)... When we have done that, we obtain p that is reduced with
 * respect to all minimal polynomials, but may still contain x_0,... x_{n-1}. To
 * get rid of these, we compute a Gröbner basis of p and the minimal polynomials
 * (using a suitable elimination order) and extract the polynomial in x_n. This
 * polynomial has all roots (and possibly some more) that we are looking for.
 * Instead of a Gröbner basis, we can also compute the iterated resultant as
 * follows: Res(Res(p, p_{n-1}, x_{n-1}), p_{n-2}, x_{n-2})...
 *
 * Consider
 * http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/AIB/2020/2020-04.pdf
 * Section 2.5.1 for a full discussion.
 *
 * !!! WARNING !!!
 * If CoCoALib is not available, this class will simply fall back to
 * poly::infeasible_regions and issue a warning about this.
