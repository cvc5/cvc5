 * Defines Constraint and ConstraintDatabase which is the internal
 * representation of variables in arithmetic
 *
 * This file defines Constraint and ConstraintDatabase.
 * A Constraint is the internal representation of literals in TheoryArithmetic.
 * Constraints are fundamentally a triple:
 *  - ArithVar associated with the constraint,
 *  - a DeltaRational value,
 *  - and a ConstraintType.
 *
 * Literals:
 *   The constraint may also keep track of a node corresponding to the
 *   Constraint.
 *   This can be accessed by getLiteral() in O(1) if it has been set.
 *   This node must be in normal form and may be used for communication with
 *   the TheoryEngine.
 *
 * In addition, Constraints keep track of the following:
 *  - A Constraint that is the negation of the Constraint.
 *  - An iterator into a set of Constraints for the ArithVar sorted by
 *    DeltaRational value.
 *  - A context dependent internal proof of the node that can be used for
 *    explanations.
 *  - Whether an equality/disequality has been split in the user context via a
 *    lemma.
 *  - Whether a constraint, be be used in explanations sent to the context
 *
 * Looking up constraints:
 *  - All of the Constraints with associated nodes in the ConstraintDatabase
 *    can be accessed via a single hashtable lookup until the Constraint is
 *    removed.
 *  - Nodes that have not been associated to a constraints can be
 *    inserted/associated to existing nodes in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Implications:
 *  - A Constraint can be used to find unate implications.
 *  - A unate implication is an implication based purely on the ArithVar
 *    matching  and the DeltaRational value.
 *    (implies (<= x c) (<= x d)) given c <= d
 *  - This is done using the iterator into the sorted set of constraints.
 *  - Given a tight constraint and previous tightest constraint, this will
 *    efficiently propagate internally.
 *
 * Additing and Removing Constraints
 *  - Adding Constraints takes O(log n) time where n is the number of
 *    constraints associated with the ArithVar.
 *  - Removing Constraints takes O(1) time.
 *
 * Internals:
 *  - Constraints are pointers to ConstraintValues.
 *  - Undefined Constraints are NullConstraint.
 *
 * Assumption vs. Assertion:
 * - An assertion is anything on the theory d_fact queue.
 *   This includes any thing propagated and returned to the fact queue.
 *   These can be used in external conflicts and propagations of earlier
 *   proofs.
 * - An assumption is anything on the theory d_fact queue that has no further
 *   explanation i.e. this theory did not propagate it.
 * - To set something an assumption, first set it as being as assertion.
 * - Internal assumptions have no explanations and must be regressed out of the
 *   proof.

 * Logs the types of different proofs.
 * Current, proof types:
 * - NoAP             : This constraint is not known to be true.
 * - AssumeAP         : This is an input assertion. There is no proof.
 *                    : Something can be both asserted and have a proof.
 * - InternalAssumeAP : An internal assumption. This has no guarantee of having an external proof.
 *                    : This must be removed by regression.
 * - FarkasAP         : A proof with Farka's coefficients, i.e.
 *                    :  \sum lambda_i ( asNode(x_i) <= c_i  ) |= 0 < 0
 *                    : If proofs are on, coefficients will be logged.
 *                    : If proofs are off, coefficients will not be logged.
 *                    : A unate implication is a FarkasAP.
 * - TrichotomyAP     : This is any entailment using (x<= a and x >=a) => x = a
 *                    : Equivalently, (x > a or x < a or x = a)
 *                    : There are 3 candidate ways this can propagate:
 *                    :   !(x > a) and !(x = a) => x < a
 *                    :   !(x < a) and !(x = a) => x > a
 *                    :   !(x > a) and !(x < a) => x = a
 * - EqualityEngineAP : This is propagated by the equality engine.
 *                    : Consult this for the proof.
 * - IntTightenAP     : This is indicates that a bound involving integers was tightened.
 *                    : e.g. i < 5.5 became i <= 5, when i is an integer.
 * - IntHoleAP        : This is currently a catch-all for all integer specific reason.

   * In this comment, we abbreviate ConstraintDatabase::d_antecedents

   *
   * This list is always empty if proofs are not enabled.
   *
   * If proofs are enabled, the proof of constraint c at p in ans[p] of length n
   * is (NullConstraint, ans[p-(n-1)], ... , ans[p-1], ans[p])
   *
   * Farkas' proofs show a contradiction with the negation of c, c_not =
   * c->getNegation().
   *
   * We treat the position for NullConstraint (p-n) as the position for the
   * farkas coefficient for so we pretend c_not is ans[p-n]. So this correlation
   * for the constraints we are going to use: (c_not, ans[p-n+(1)], ... ,
   * ans[p-n+(n-1)], ans[p-n+(n)]) With the coefficients at positions: (fc[0],
   * fc[1)], ... fc[n])
   *
   * The index of the constraints in the proof are {i | i <= 0 <= n] } (with
   * c_not being p-n). Partition the indices into L, U, and E, the lower bounds,
   * the upper bounds and equalities.
   *
   * We standardize the proofs to be upper bound oriented following the
   * convention: A x <= b with the proof witness of the form (lambda) Ax <=
   * (lambda) b and lambda >= 0.
   *
   * To accomplish this cleanly, the fc coefficients must be negative for lower
   * bounds. The signs of equalities can be either positive or negative.
   *
   * Thus the proof corresponds to (with multiplication over inequalities):
   *    \sum_{u in U} fc[u] ans[p-n+u] + \sum_{e in E} fc[e] ans[p-n+e]
   *  + \sum_{l in L} fc[l] ans[p-n+l]
   * |= 0 < 0
   * where fc[u] > 0, fc[l] < 0, and fc[e] != 0 (i.e. it can be either +/-).
   *
   * There is no requirement that the proof is minimal.
   * We do however use all of the constraints by requiring non-zero
   * coefficients.
