   * null TrustNode may be returned. This is an optimization to avoid
   * constructing the trivial equality (= node node) internally within
   * TrustNode.
   *
   * The purpose of this method is typically to eliminate the operators in node
   * that are syntax sugar that cannot otherwise be eliminated during rewriting.
   * For example, division relies on the introduction of an uninterpreted
   * function for the divide-by-zero case, which we do not introduce with
   * the standard rewrite methods.
   *
   * Some theories have kinds that are effectively definitions and should be
   * expanded before they are handled.  Definitions allow a much wider range of
   * actions than the normal forms given by the rewriter. However no
   * assumptions can be made about subterms having been expanded or rewritten.
   * Where possible rewrite rules should be used, definitions should only be
   * used when rewrites are not possible, for example in handling
   * under-specified operations using partially defined functions.
