/**
 * A LogicInfo instance describes a collection of theory modules and some
 * basic configuration about them.  Conceptually, it provides a background
 * context for all operations in cvc5.  Typically, when cvc5's SmtEngine
 * is created, it is issued a setLogic() command indicating features of the
 * assertions and queries to follow---for example, whether quantifiers are
 * used, whether integers or reals (or both) will be used, etc.
 *
 * Most places in cvc5 will only ever need to access a const reference to an
 * instance of this class.  Such an instance is generally set by the SmtEngine
 * when setLogic() is called.  However, mutating member functions are also
 * provided by this class so that it can be used as a more general mechanism
 * (e.g., for communicating to the SmtEngine which theories should be used,
 * rather than having to provide an SMT-LIB string).
