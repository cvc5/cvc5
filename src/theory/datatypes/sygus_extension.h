/**
 * This is the sygus extension of the decision procedure for quantifier-free
 * inductive datatypes. At a high level, this class takes as input a
 * set of asserted testers is-C1( x ), is-C2( x.1 ), is-C3( x.2 ), and
 * generates lemmas that restrict the models of x, if x is a "sygus enumerator"
 * (see TermDbSygus::registerEnumerator).
 *
 * Some of these techniques are described in these papers:
 * "Refutation-Based Synthesis in SMT", Reynolds et al 2017.
 * "Sygus Techniques in the Core of an SMT Solver", Reynolds et al 2017.
 *
 * This class enforces two decisions stragies via calls to registerStrategy
 * of the owning theory's DecisionManager:
 * (1) Positive decisions on the active guards G of enumerators e registered
 * to this class. These assert "there are more values to enumerate for e".
 * (2) Positive bounds (DT_SYGUS_BOUND m n) for "measure terms" m (see below),
 * where n is a non-negative integer. This asserts "the measure of terms
 * we are enumerating for enumerators whose measure term m is at most n",
 * where measure is commonly term size, but can also be height.
 *
 * We prioritize decisions of form (1) before (2). Both kinds of decision are
 * critical for solution completeness, which is enforced by DecisionManager.

   *
   * For example, consider the term:
   *   f( x_1, g( x_2, x_3 ) )
   * and a left-to-right, depth-first traversal of this term. Let e be
   * a variable of the same type as this term. We say that for the above term:
   *   pre_{x_1} is false for e, e.1 and true for e.2, e.2.1, e.2.2
   *   pre_{x_2} is false for e, e.1, e.2, e.2.1, and true for e.2.2
   *   pre_{x_3} is false for e, e.1, e.2, e.2.1, e.2.2
   *   post_{x_1} is true for e.1, e.2.1, e.2.2, e.2, e
   *   post_{x_2} is false for e.1 and true for e.2.1, e.2.2, e.2, e
   *   post_{x_3} is false for e.1, e.2.1 and true for e.2.2, e.2, e
   *
   * We enforce a symmetry breaking scheme for each enumerator e that is
   * "variable-agnostic" (see argument isVarAgnostic in registerEnumerator)
   * that ensures the variables are ordered. This scheme makes use of these
   * predicates, described in the following:
   *
   * Let x_1, ..., x_m be variables that occur in the same subclass in the type
   * of e (see TermDbSygus::getSubclassForVar).
   * For i = 1, ..., m:
   *   // each variable does not occur initially in a traversal of e
   *   ~pre_{x_i}( e ) AND
   *   // for each subterm of e
   *   template z.
   *     // if this is variable x_i, then x_{i-1} must have already occurred
   *     is-x_i( z ) => pre_{x_{i-1}}( z ) AND
   *     for args a = 1...n
   *       // pre-definition for each argument of this term
   *       pre_{x_i}( z.a ) = a=0 ? pre_{x_i}( z ) : post_{x_i}( z.{a-1} ) AND
   *     // post-definition for this term
   *     post_{x_i}( z ) = post_{x_i}( z.n ) OR is-x_i( z )
   *
   * For clarity, above we have written pre and post as first-order predicates.
   * However, applications of pre/post should be seen as indexed Boolean
   * variables. The reason for this is pre and post cannot be given a consistent
   * semantics. For example, consider term f( x_1, x_1 ) and enumerator variable
   * e of the same type over which we are encoding a traversal. We have that
   * pre_{x_1}( e.1 ) is false and pre_{x_1}( e.2 ) is true, although the model
   * values for e.1 and e.2 are equal. Instead, pre_{x_1}( e.1 ) should be seen
   * as a Boolean variable V_pre_{x_1,e.1} indexed by x_1 and e.1. and likewise
   * for e.2. We convert all applications of pre/post to Boolean variables in
   * the method eliminateTraversalPredicates below. Nevertheless, it is
   * important that applications pre and post are encoded as APPLY_UF
   * applications so that they behave as expected under substitutions. For
   * example, pre_{x_1}( z.1 ) { z -> e.2 } results in pre_{x_1}( e.2.1 ), which
   * after eliminateTraversalPredicates is V_pre_{x_1, e.2.1}.

   *
   * This function is called when a selector chain n has been assigned a model
   * value nv. This function calls itself recursively so that extensions of the
   * selector chain n are registered with all the subterms of nv. For example,
   * if we call this function with:
   *   n = x, nv = +( 1(), x() )
   * we make recursive calls with:
   *   n = x.1, nv = 1() and n = x.2, nv = x()
   *
   * a : the anchor of n,
   * d : the depth of n.
   *
   * This function determines if the value nv is equivalent via rewriting to
   * any previously registered search values for anchor a. If so, we construct
   * a symmetry breaking lemma template and register it in d_cache[a]. For
   * example, for grammar:
   *   A -> A+A | x | 1 | 0
   * Registering search value d -> x followed by d -> +( x, 0 ) results in the
   * construction of the symmetry breaking lemma template:
   *   ~is_+( z ) V ~is_x( z.1 ) V ~is_0( z.2 )
   * which is stored in d_cache[a].d_sbLemmas. This lemma is instantiated with
   * z -> t for all terms t of appropriate depth, including d.
   * This function strengthens blocking clauses using generalization techniques
   * described in Reynolds et al SYNT 2017.
   *
   * The return value of this function is an abstraction of model assignment
   * of nv to n, or null if we wish to exclude the model assignment nv to n.
   * The return value of this method is different from nv itself, e.g. if it
   * contains occurrences of the "any constant" constructor. For example, if
   * nv is C_+( C_x(), C_{any_constant}( 5 ) ), then the return value of this
   * function will either be null, or C_+( C_x(), C_{any_constant}( n.1.0 ) ),
   * where n.1.0 is the appropriate selector chain applied to n. We build this
   * abstraction since the semantics of C_{any_constant} is "any constant" and
   * not "some constant". Thus, we should consider the subterm
   * C_{any_constant}( 5 ) above to be an unconstrained variable (as represented
   * by a selector chain), instead of the concrete value 5.
   *
   * The flag isVarAgnostic is whether "a" is a variable agnostic enumerator. If
   * this is the case, we restrict symmetry breaking to subterms of n on its
   * leftmost subchain. For example, consider the grammar:
   *   A -> B=B
   *   B -> B+B | x | y | 0
   * Say we are registering the search value x = y+x. Notice that this value is
   * ordered. If a were a variable-agnostic enumerator of type A in this
   * case, we would only register x = y+x and x, and not y+x or y, since the
   * latter two terms are not leftmost subterms in this value. If we did on the
   * other hand register y+x, we would be prevented from solutions like x+y = 0
   * later, since x+y is equivalent to (the already registered value) y+x.
   *
   * If doSym is false, we are not performing symmetry breaking on n. This flag
   * is set to false on branches of n that are not leftmost.
