  /** collect references
   *
   * This function, given as input a codatatype term n, collects the necessary
   * information for constructing a (canonical) codatatype constant that is
   * equivalent to n if one exists, or null otherwise.
   *
   * In particular it returns a term ret such that all non-codatatype datatype
   * subterms of n are replaced by a constant that is equal to them via a
   * (mutually) recursive call to normalizeConstant above. Additionally, this
   * function replaces references to mu-binders with fresh variables.
   * In detail, mu-terms are represented by uninterpreted constants of datatype
   * type that carry their Debruijn index.
   *
   * Consider the example of a codatatype representing a stream of integers:
   *   Stream := cons( head : Int, tail : Stream )
   * The stream 1,0,1,0,1,0... when written in mu-notation is the term:
   *   mu x. cons( 1, mu y. cons( 0, x ) )
   * This is represented in cvc5 by the Node:
   *   cons( 1, cons( 0, c[1] ) )
   * where c[1] is a uninterpreted constant datatype with Debruijn index 1,
   * indicating that c[1] is nested underneath 1 level on the path to the
   * term which it binds. On the other hand, the stream 1,0,0,0,0,... is
   * represented by the codatatype term:
   *   cons( 1, cons( 0, c[0] ) )
   *
   * Subterms that are references to mu-binders in n are replaced by a new
   * variable. If n contains any subterm that is a reference to a mu-binder not
   * bound in n, then we return null. For example we return null when n is:
   *   cons( 1, cons( 0, c[2] ) )
   * since c[2] is not bound by this codatatype term.
   *
   * All valid references to mu-binders are replaced by a variable that is
   * unique for the term it references. For example, for the infinite tree
   * codatatype: Tree : node( data : Int, left : Tree, right : Tree ) If n is
   * the term: node( 0, c[0], node( 1, c[0], c[1] ) ) then the return value ret
   * of this function is: node( 0, x, node( 1, y, x ) ) where x refers to the
   * root of the term and y refers to the right tree of the root.
   *
   * The argument sk stores the current set of node that we are traversing
   * beneath. The argument rf_pending stores, for each node that we are
   * traversing beneath either null or the free variable that we are using to
   * refer to its mu-binder. The remaining arguments store information that is
   * relevant when performing normalization of n using the value of ret:
   *
   * rf : maps subterms of n to the corresponding term in ret for all subterms
   * where the corresponding term in ret is different.
   * terms : stores all subterms of ret.
   * cdts : for each term t in terms, stores whether t is a codatatype.
