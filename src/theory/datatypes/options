# How to handle selectors applied to incorrect constructors.  If this option is set,
# then we do not rewrite such a selector term to an arbitrary ground term.  
# For example, by default cvc4 considers cdr( nil ) = nil.  If this option is set, then
# cdr( nil ) has no set value.
expert-option dtRewriteErrorSel /--disable-dt-rewrite-error-sel bool :default true
 disable rewriting incorrectly applied selectors to arbitrary ground term
option dtForceAssignment /--dt-force-assignment bool :default false :read-write
 force the datatypes solver to give specific values to all datatypes terms before answering sat
