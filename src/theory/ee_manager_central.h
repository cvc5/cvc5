/**
 * The (central) equality engine manager. This encapsulates an architecture
 * in which all applicable theories use a single central equality engine.
 *
 * This class is not responsible for actually initializing equality engines in
 * theories (since this class does not have access to the internals of Theory).
 * Instead, it is only responsible for the construction of the equality
 * engine objects themselves. TheoryEngine is responsible for querying this
 * class during finishInit() to determine the equality engines to pass to each
 * theories based on getEeTheoryInfo.
 *
 * It also may allocate a "master" equality engine, which is intuitively the
 * equality engine of the theory of quantifiers. If all theories use the
 * central equality engine, then the master equality engine is the same as the
 * central equality engine.
 *
 * The theories that use central equality engine are determined by
 * Theory::usesCentralEqualityEngine.
 *
 * The main idea behind this class is to use a notification class on the
 * central equality engine which dispatches *multiple* notifications to the
 * theories that use the central equality engine.
