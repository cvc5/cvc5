/** representative set
 *
 * This class contains finite lists of values for types, typically values and
 * types that exist
 * in the equality engine of a model object.  In the following, "representative"
 * means a value that exists in this set.
 *
 * This class is used for finite model finding and other exhaustive
 * instantiation-based
 * methods. The class goes beyond just maintaining a list of values that occur
 * in the equality engine in the following ways:
 
 * (1) It maintains a partial mapping from representatives to a term that has
 * that value in the current
 * model.  This is important because algorithms like the instantiation method in
 * Reynolds et al CADE 2013
 * act on "term models" where domains in models are interpreted as a set of
 * representative terms. Hence,
 * instead of instantiating with e.g. uninterpreted constants u, we instantiate
 * with the corresponding term that is interpreted as u.
 
 * (2) It is mutable, calls to add(...) and complete(...) may modify this class
 * as necessary, for instance
 * in the case that there are no ground terms of a type that occurs in a
 * quantified formula, or for
 * exhaustive instantiation strategies that enumerate over small interpreted
 * finite types.
