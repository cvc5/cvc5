/*
** Converts bit-vector formulas to integer formulas.
** The conversion is implemented using a translation function Tr,
** roughly described as follows:
**
** Tr(x) = fresh_x for every bit-vector variable x, where fresh_x is a fresh
**         integer variable.
** Tr(c) = the integer value of c, for any bit-vector constant c.
** Tr((bvadd s t)) = Tr(s) + Tr(t) mod 2^k, where k is the bit width of
**         s and t.
** Similar transformations are done for bvmul, bvsub, bvudiv, bvurem, bvneg,
**         bvnot, bvconcat, bvextract
** Tr((_ zero_extend m) x) = Tr(x)
** Tr((_ sign_extend m) x) = ite(msb(x)=0, x, 2^k*(2^m-1) + x))
** explanation: if the msb is 0, this is the same as zero_extend,
** which does not change the integer value.
** If the msb is 1, then the result should correspond to
** concat(1...1, x), with m 1's.
** m 1's is 2^m-1, and multiplying it by x's width (k) moves it
** to the front.
**
** Tr((bvand s t)) depends on the granularity, which is provided via an option.
** We divide s and t to blocks.
** The size of each block is the granularity, and so the number of
** blocks is:
** bit width/granularity (rounded down).
** We create an ITE that represents an arbitrary block,
** and then create a sum by mutiplying each block by the
** appropriate power of two.
** More formally:
** Let g denote the granularity.
** Let k denote the bit width of s and t.
** Let b denote floor(k/g) if k >= g, or just k otherwise.
** Tr((bvand s t)) =
** Sigma_{i=0}^{b-1}(bvand s[(i+1)*g, i*g] t[(i+1)*g, i*g])*2^(i*g)
**
** bvor, bvxor, bvxnor, bvnand, bvnor -- are eliminated and so bvand is the
*only bit-wise operator that is directly handled.
**
** Tr((bvshl a b)) = ite(Tr(b) >= k, 0, Tr(a)*ITE), where k is the bit width of
**         a and b, and ITE represents exponentiation up to k, that is:
** ITE = ite(Tr(b)=0, 1, ite(Tr(b)=1), 2, ite(Tr(b)=2, 4, ...))
** Similar transformations are done for bvlshr.
**
** Tr(a=b) = Tr(a)=Tr(b)
** Tr((bvult a b)) = Tr(a) < Tr(b)
** Similar transformations are done for bvule, bvugt, and bvuge.
**
** Bit-vector operators that are not listed above are either
** eliminated using the BV rewriter,
** or go through the following default
** translation, that also works for non-bit-vector operators
** with result type BV:
** Tr((op t1 ... tn)) = (bv2nat (op (cast t1) ... (cast tn)))
** where (cast x) is ((_ nat2bv k) x) or just x,
** depending on the type of the corresponding argument of
** op.
