/**
 * Decision strategy finite model finding.
 *
 * This is a virtual base class for decision strategies that follow the
 * "finite model finding" pattern for decisions. Such strategies have the
 * distinguishing feature that they are interested in a stream of literals
 * L_1, L_2, L_3, ... and so on. At any given time, they request that L_i is
 * asserted true for a minimal i.
 *
 * To enforce this strategy, this class maintains a SAT-context dependent
 * index d_curr_literal, which corresponds to the minimal index of a literal
 * in the above list that is not asserted false. A call to
 * getNextDecisionRequest increments this value until we find a literal L_j
 * that is not assigned false. If L_j is unassigned, we return it as a decision,
 * otherwise we return no decisions.
