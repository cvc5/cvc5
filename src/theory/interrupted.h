 * An exception signaling that a Theory should immediately stop
 * performing processing and relinquish control to its caller (e.g.,
 * in a parallel environment).  A Theory might be interrupted if it
 * calls into its cvc5::theory::OutputChannel, and it should only
 * catch this exception to perform emergency repair of any invariants
 * it must re-establish.  Further, if this exception is caught by a
 * Theory, the Theory should rethrow the same exception (via "throw;"
 * in the exception block) rather than return, as the Interrupted
 * instance might contain additional information needed for the
 * proper management of cvc5 components.
