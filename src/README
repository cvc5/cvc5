High level changes needed:

- TheoryEngine passes a ProofOutputChannel to each Theory instead of an OutputChannel when in proof producing mode. It uses this object to extract proofs for theory lemmas when needed.
- TheoryEngine owns a ProofChecker that can check any kind of proof in proof_kinds files.
- Based on proof_kinds, we auto-generate:
(1) The PfRule enumeration,
(2) Printing for PfRule,
(3) Initialization of the ProofChecker owned by TheoryEngine,
(4) The code for checking (?)

Notes:
- Theory does not need to be concerned what a ProofNode is. It manages TrustNode objects but doesnt care about their contents.
- Similar to above, the user of a ProofEqEngine does not care about what a ProofNode is. Its input interface is similar to EqualityEngine, i.e. Node, its output interface is in terms of TrustNode.
- Theory can have as many ProofGenerator objects as it wants. It should have one for each kind of reasoning it does.
- ProofNodeManager does not need to be global.
