/** Higher-order elimination.
 *
 * This preprocessing pass eliminates all occurrences of higher-order
 * constraints in the input, and replaces the entire input problem with
 * an equisatisfiable one. This is based on the following steps.
 *
 * [1] Eliminate all occurrences of lambdas via lambda lifting. This includes
 * lambdas with free variables that occur in quantifier bodies (see
 * documentation for eliminateLambdaComplete).
 *
 * [2] Eliminate all occurrences of partial applications and constraints
 * involving functions as first-class members. This is done by first
 * turning all function applications into an applicative encoding involving the
 * parametric binary operator @ (of kind HO_APPLY). Then we introduce:
 * - An uninterpreted sort U(T) for each function type T,
 * - A function H(f) of sort U(T1) x .. x U(Tn) -> U(T) for each function f
 * of sort T1 x ... x Tn -> T.
 * - A function App_{T1 x T2 ... x Tn -> T} of type
 *   U(T1 x T2 ... x Tn -> T) x U(T1) -> U(T2 ... x Tn -> T)
 * for each occurrence of @ applied to arguments of types T1 x T2 ... x Tn -> T
 * and T1.
 *
 * [3] Add additional axioms to ensure the correct interpretation of
 * the sorts U(...), and functions App_{...}. This includes:
 *
 * - The "extensionality" axiom for App_{...} terms, stating that functions
 * that behave the same according to App for all inputs must be equal:
 *   forall x : U(T1->T2), y : U(T1->T2).
 *      ( forall z : T1. App_{T1->T2}( x, z ) = App_{T1->T2}( y, z ) ) =>
 *        x = y
 *
 * - The "store" axiom, which effectively states that for all (encoded)
 * functions f, there exists a function g that behaves identically to f, except
 * that g for argument i is e:
 *   forall x : U(T1->T2), i : U(T1), e : U(T2).
 *     exists g : U(T1->T2).
 *       forall z: T1.
 *         App_{T1->T2}( g, z ) = ite( z = i, e, App_{T1->T2}( f, z ) ).
 *
 *
 * Based on options, this preprocessing pass may apply a subset o the above
 * steps. In particular:
 * * If options::hoElim() is true, then step [2] is taken and extensionality
 * axioms are added in step [3].
 * * If options::hoElimStoreAx() is true, then store axioms are added in step 3.
 * The form of these axioms depends on whether options::hoElim() is true. If it
 * is true, the axiom is given in terms of the uninterpreted functions that
 * encode function sorts. If it is false, then the store axiom is given in terms
 * of the original function sorts.

   * (lambda) definition, which is a closed term.
   *
   * Notice that to ensure that all lambda definitions are closed, we
   * introduce extra bound arguments to the lambda, for example:
   *    forall x. (lambda y. x+y) != f
   * becomes
   *    forall x. g(x) != f
   * where g is mapped to the (closed) term ( lambda xy. x+y ).
   *
   * Notice that the definitions in newLambda may themselves contain lambdas,
   * hence, this method is run until a fix point is reached.
