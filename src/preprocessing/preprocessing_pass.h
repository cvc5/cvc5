 * The preprocessing pass super class
 *
 * Implementation of the preprocessing pass super class. Preprocessing passes
 * that inherit from this class, need to pass their name to the constructor to
 * register the pass appropriately. The core of a preprocessing pass lives
 * in applyInternal(), which operates on a list of assertions and is called
 * from apply() in the super class. The apply() method automatically takes
 * care of the following:
 *
 * - Dumping assertions before and after the pass
 * - Initializing the timer
 * - Tracing and chatting
 *
 * Optionally, preprocessing passes can overwrite the initInteral() method to
 * do work that only needs to be done once.
