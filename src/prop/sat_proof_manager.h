/**
 * This class is responsible for managing the proof production of the SAT
 * solver. It tracks resolutions produced during solving and stores them,
 * independently, with the connection of the resolutions only made when the
 * empty clause is produced and the refutation is complete. The expected
 * assumptions of the refutation are the clausified preprocessed assertions and
 * lemmas.
 *
 * These resolutions are stored in a LazyCDProofChain, a user-context-dependent
 * proof that takes lazy steps and can connect them when generating a proof for
 * a given fact. Its use in this proof manager is so that, assuming the
 * following lazy steps are saved in the LazyCDProofChain:
 *
 * --- S0: (l4,          PG0)
 * --- S1: ((or l3 l4),  PG1)
 * --- S2: ((or l1 ~l3), PG2)
 * --- S3: (false,       PG3)
 * --- S4: (~l2,         PG4)
 * --- S5: (~l3,         PG5)
 * --- S6: (~l5,         PG6)
 *
 * when requesting the proof of false, assuming that the proof generators have
 * the following expansions:
 *
 * --- PG0 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l4 l1) ~l1))
 * --- PG1 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l3 l5 l6 l7) ~l5 (or ~l6 l7) (or l4 ~l7)))
 * --- PG2 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l1 ~l3 l5) ~l5))
 * --- PG3 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l1 l2) ~l1 ~l2))
 * --- PG4 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l3 ~l2) ~l3))
 * --- PG5 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l1 ~l3) ~l1))
 * --- PG6 -> (CHAIN_RES ((or l1 ~l5) ~l1))
 *
 * will connect the independent resolutions and yield the following refutation
 *
 *                                             (or l1 ~l5)  ~l1
 *                                             ---------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                            (or l1 ~l3 l5)   ~l5
 *                            ---------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                                      (or l1 ~l3)              ~l1
 *                                      ----------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                       (or l3 ~l2)     ~l3
 *                       -------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *   (or l1 l2)   ~l1    ~l2
 *  --------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *              false
 *
 * where note that the steps S0 and S1, for l4 and (or l3 l4), respectively,
 * were ignored, since they were not part of the chain starting with
 * false. Moreover there is no requirement that the steps are registered
 * chronologically in the LazyCDProofChain. The chain started on step S3 and
 * proceeded to steps S4, S5, S2, and finally S6.
 *
 * To track the reasoning of the SAT solver and produce the steps above this
 * class does three main things:
 *  (1) Register the resolutions for learned clauses as they are learned.
 *  (2) Register the resolutions for propagated literals when necessary.
 *  (3) Register the *full* resolution proof for the empty clause.
 *
 * Case (1) covers the learned clauses during backjumping. The only information
 * saved is that, from clauses C1 to Cn, a given learned clause C is derived via
 * chain resolution (and possibly factoring, reordering and double negation
 * elimination in its literals), i.e., we do not recursively prove C1 to Cn at
 * this moment.
 *
 * Not explaining C1 to Cn eagerly is beneficial because:
 * - we might be wasting resources in fully explanaining it now, since C may not
 *   be necessary for the derivation of the empty clause, and
 * - in explaining clauses lazily we might have shorter explanations, which has
 *   been observed empirically to be often the case.
 *
 * The latter case is a result of the SAT solver possibly changing the
 * explanation of each of C, C1 to Cn, or the components of their
 * explanations. This is because the set of propagated literals that may be used
 * in these explanations can change in different SAT contexts, with the same
 * clause being derived several times, each from a different set of clauses.
 *
 * Therefore we only fully explain a clause when absolutely necessary, i.e.,
 * when we are done (see case (3)) or when we'd not be able to do it afterwards
 * (see case (2)). In the example above, step S2 is generated from case (1),
 * with the shallow proof
 *
 *        (or l1 ~l3 l5)       ~l5
 *        ------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                 (or l1 ~l3)
 *
 * explaining the learned clause (or l1 ~l3). Its full proof would only be
 * produced if it were part of the final refutation, as it indeed is. Note that
 * in the example above the refutation proof contains the resolution proof of
 * ~l5.
 *
 * Case (2) covers:
 *  (2.1) propagated literals explained by clauses being deleted
 *  (2.2) propagated literals whose negation occurs in a learned clause, which
 *  are then deleted for being redundant.
 *
 * Case (2.1) only happens for the so-called "locked clauses", which are clauses
 * C = l1 v ... v ln that propagate their first literal, l1. When a locked
 * clause C is deleted we save a chain resolution proof of l1 because we'd not
 * be able to retrieve C afterwards, since it is deleted. The proof is a chain
 * resolution step between C and ~l2, ..., ~ln, concluding l1. In the example
 * above, step S0 is generated from case (2.1), with the locked clause (or l4
 * l1) being deleted and requiring the registration in the LazyCDPRoofChain of a
 * lazy step for
 *
 *         (or l4 l1)       ~l1
 *      ------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *               l4
 *
 * Case (2.2) requires that, when a redundant literal (i.e., a literal whose
 * negation is propagated) is deleted from a learned clause, we add the
 * explanation of its negation to the chain resolution proof of the learned
 * clause. This justifies the deletion of the redundant literal. However, the
 * explanation for the propagated literal (the SAT solver maintains a map from
 * propagated literals to the clauses that propagate them in the current
 * context, i.e., their explanations, clauses in which all literals but the
 * propagated one have their negation propagated) may also contain literals that
 * were in the learned clause and were deleted for being redundant. Therefore
 * eliminating a redundant literal requires recursively explaining the
 * propagated literals in its explanation as long as they are, themselves,
 * redundant literals in the learned clause.
 *
 * In the above example step S1, concluding (or l3 l4), is generated from the
 * resolutions
 *
 *   (or l3 l5 l6 l7)    ~l5
 *  -------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *     (or l3 l6 l7)                        (or ~l6 l7)   (or l4 ~l7)
 *    ---------------------------------------------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                           (or l3 l4)
 *
 * as l6 and l7 are redundant, which leads to (or l3 l6 l7) being resolved with
 * l6's explanation, (or ~l6 l7). The literals in the explanation of l7 are
 * recursively explained if they are also redundant, which is the case for l7,
 * so its explanation is also added as premise for the resolution. Since l4 is
 * not redundant, it is not recursively explained.
 *
 * Note that the actual proof generated does not have the intermediary step
 * before removing redundant literals. It's all done in one fell swoop:
 *
 *   (or l3 l5 l6 l7)   ~l5   (or ~l6 l7)   (or l4 ~l7)
 *   --------------------------------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                           (or l3 l4)
 *
 * Finally, case (3) happens when the SAT solver derives the empty clause and
 * it's not possible to backjump. The empty clause is learned from a conflict
 * clause: a clause whose every literal has its negation propagated in the
 * current context. Thus the proof of the empty clause is generated, at first,
 * in the same way as case (1): a resolution chain betweeen the conflict clause
 * and its negated literals. However, since we are now done, we recursively
 * explain the propagated literals, starting from the negated literals from the
 * conflict clause and progressing to all propagated literals ocurring in a
 * given explanation.
 *
 * In the above example this happens as: step S3
 *
 *    (or l1 l2)   ~l1    ~l2
 *  --------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *             false
 *
 * is added for a conflict clause (or l1 l2). Then we attempt to explain ~l1 and
 * ~l2. The former has no explanation (i.e., it's an input), while the latter
 * has explanation (or l3 ~l2). This leads to step S4
 *
 *  (or l3 ~l2)     ~l3
 *  -------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *        ~l2
 *
 * being added to the LazyCDProofChain. In explaining ~l3 the step S5
 *
 *  (or l1 ~l3)      ~l1
 *  --------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *         ~l3
 *
 * is added. Since ~l1 has no explanation, the process halts. Note that at this
 * point the step S6 has not been added to the LazyCDProofChain. This is because
 * to explain ~l5 we need to look at the literal premises in the proofs of
 * learned clauses.
 *
 * The last thing done then in case (3), after the resolution on the conflict
 * clause and an initial recursive explanation of propagated literals, is to
 * connect the refutation proof and then recursively its propagated literal
 * leaves, repeating until a fix point.
 *
 * In the above example the first connection yields
 *
 *                           (or l1 ~l3 l5)   ~l5
 *                           ---------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                                     (or l1 ~l3)              ~l1
 *                                     ----------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                      (or l3 ~l2)     ~l3
 *                      -------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *  (or l1 l2)   ~l1    ~l2
 * --------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                     false
 *
 * whose literal leaves are ~l1 and ~l5. The former has no explanation, but the
 * latter is explained by (or l1 ~l5), thus leading to step S6
 *
 *  (or l1 ~l5)      ~l1
 *  --------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *         ~l5
 *
 * then the final connection
 *
 *                                             (or l1 ~l5)  ~l1
 *                                             ---------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                            (or l1 ~l3 l5)   ~l5
 *                            ---------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                                      (or l1 ~l3)              ~l1
 *                                      ----------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                       (or l3 ~l2)     ~l3
 *                       -------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *   (or l1 l2)   ~l1    ~l2
 *  --------------------------- CHAIN_RES
 *                      false
 *
 * which has no more explainable literals as leaves.
