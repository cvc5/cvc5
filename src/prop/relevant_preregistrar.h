/**
 * The relevant preregistration policy. This implements a policy where
 * only a subset of theory literals are preregistered at any given time.
 * This selection is based on a notion of relevance. Some simple examples
 * of the intuition:
 * - Say (or A B C) is an input formula and no literal is assigned, then we
 * preregister A only.
 * - Say (or A B C) is an input formula and A is already asserted true, then we
 * preregister nothing since this formula is already justifed.
 * - Say (and A B C) is an input formula, then we preregister A, B, C.
 * - Say (= A (and B C)) is an input formula and A is already asserted true,
 * then we preregister B and C, since assigning either B or C to false would
 * derive a conflict.
 * - Say (= A (and B C)) is an input formula and A is already asserted false,
 * then we preregister B only, since both B and C would have to be true to
 * derive a conflict.
 * - Say (ite A B C) is an input formula and A is already asserted false, then
 * we preregister C.
 *
 * The intuition in the above cases is that we want to preregister only
 * the literals that, if they were to be T-propagated, could contribute towards
 * a SAT conflict in the current context.
 *
 * More generally, this class tracks relevance on formulas in the input. All
 * top-level input formulas and lemmas are assigned relevance true. A formula
 * marked relevant may cause its children to be relevant. Any theory literal
 * marked relevant (in either polarity) is preregistered.

   *
   * This may add literals to preregister to toPreregister, or modify the list
   * of formulas to visit (toVisit), e.g. either by popping n from this vector,
   * or pushing its direct children to this vector.
   *
   * In detail, we consider the state of how n has been processed (which is
   * stored in d_pstate[n]), and whether n has already been justified (via
   * d_jcache):
   *
   * If n has already been justified, there is nothing to do, we pop n from
   * toVisit and return.
   *
   * Otherwise, this method depends on the relevance of n and its kind. The
   * following describes what is done, where this method implements
   * one step of the overall behavior:
   *
   * - If n is a conjunction/disjunction that requires all children to be a
   * certain value to be justified (e.g. AND with relevance true, OR with
   * relevance false), then we do two passes (RlvInfo::d_iter):
   *   - On the first iteration (d_iter=0), we iterate over children, marking
   *     them as relevant. If we encounter a child that is justified with a
   *     value that implies ours (e.g. a false child of AND), then we mark
   *     ourselves as justified and stop the iteration.
   *   - On the second iteration (d_iter=1), we iterate over children. If
   *     we encounter a child whose value is unknown, we mark it as watched,
   *     i.e. we stop iterating and our relevance is updated when its value is
   *     assigned. If all children have values, note these values are
   *     non-forcing, and we mark ourselves justified (i.e. an AND with all
   *     true children is justified true).
   * - If n is a conjunction/disjunction that requires one child to be a
   * certain value to be justified (e.g. AND with relevance false, OR with
   * relevance true), then:
   *    - We iterate over children, marking them as relevant. If we encounter
   *      a child that is justified with a value that implies ours, then we mark
   *      ourselves as justified and stop the iteration. If we encounter a
   *      child whose value is unknown, we mark that child as watched and stop
   *      the iteration until it has a value. If all children have values, we
   *      mark ourselves justified with the appropriate value.
   * - If n is ITE/XOR/EQUAL, then:
   *    - We mark the first child as relevant with unknown (both) polarities.
   *    - If the first child is assigned a value, then based on that value,
   *      we mark another child as relevant: if n is ITE, then the relevant
   *      branch is marked relevant; if n is XOR/EQUAL, then the right hand
   *      side is marked relevant with the appropriate polarity.
   *    - When two children have values, then we mark ourselves justified with
   *      the appropriate value.
   * - If n is a theory literal, is added to toPreregister.
