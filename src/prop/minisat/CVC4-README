================ CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL CODE ==================================

The only cvc5 connections passed to minisat are the proxy (defined in sat.h) and
the context. The context is obtained from the SolverEngine, and the proxy is an 
intermediary class that has all-access to the SatSolver so as to simplify the 
interface to (possible) other sat solvers. These two are passed to minisat at 
construction time and some additional flags are set. We use the SimpSolver 
solver with simplifications.

To compare with original minisat code in SVN you can compare to revision 6 on 
the trunk.

The PropEngine then uses the following

// Create the sat solver (this is the proxy, which will create minisat)
d_satSolver = new SatSolver(this, d_theoryEngine, d_context);
// Add some clauses
d_cnfStream->convertAndAssert(node);
// Check for satisfiabilty 
bool result = d_satSolver->solve();

* Adding theory literals:

The newVar method has been changed from 
  Var Solver::newVar(bool sign, bool dvar)
to 
  Var Solver::newVar(bool sign, bool dvar, bool theoryAtom)
in order to mark the variables as theory literals. For that purpose there is a 
new boolean array called "theory" that is true or false if the variables is for
a theory literal.

* Backtracking/Pushing

Backtracking in minisat is performed through the cancelUntil() method, which is 
now modified to pop the context the appropriate number of times.

Minisat pushes the scope in the newDecisionLevel() method where we appropriately 
also push the cvc5 context.

* Phase caching

In order to implement phase-caching (RSAT paper) we 
(1) flag minisat to use the user-provided polarities first by setting the 
minisat::SimpSolver::polarity_user flag when initializing the solver (in sat.h)
(2) when a variable is set (in uncheckedEnqueue()) we remember the value in the
"polarity" table.

* Asserting the theory literals

In the uncheckedEnqueue() method, if the literal is a theory literal (looking 
in the "theory" table), it is passed to the prop engine thorough the proxy. 

* Theory propagation (checking)

The BCP propagation method was changed from propagate to propagateBool and 
another method propagateTheory is defined to do the theory propagation. The 
propagate method now looks like

Clause* Solver::propagate()
{
    Clause* confl = NULL;

    while(qhead < trail.size()) {
      confl = propagateBool();
      if (confl != NULL) break;
      confl = propagateTheory();
      if (confl != NULL) break;
    }

    return confl;
}

The propagateBool method will perform the BCP on the newly assigned variables 
in the trail, and if a conflict is found it will break. Otherwise, the theory 
propagation is given a chance to check for satisfiability and maybe enqueue some
additional propagated literals. 

* Conflict resolution

If a conflict is detected during theory propagation we can rely on the minisat
conflict resolution with a twist. Since a theory can return a conflict where
all literals are assigned at a level lower than the current level, we must 
backtrack to the highest level of any literal in the conflict. This is done
already in the propagateTheory().  

* Clause simplification

Minisat performs some simplifications on the clause database:
(1) variable elimination
(2) subsumtion

Subsumtion is complete even with theory reasoning, but eliminating theory 
literals by resolution might be incomplete:

(x = 0 \vee x = 1) \wedge (x != 1 \vee y = 1) \wedge x = y
            ^^^^^          ^^^^^^
              v              ~v

would, after eliminating v, simplify to
(x = 0) wedge (y = 1) wedge (x = y) which is unsatisfiable

while x = 1, y = 1 is a satisfying assignment for the above.

Minisat does not perform variable elimination on the variables that are marked
as frozen (in the "frozen", SimSolver.h) table. We put all the theory literals 
in the frozen table, which solves the incompleteness problem. 

================ NOTES =========================================================

* Accessing the internals of the SAT solver

The non-public parts of the SAT solver are accessed via the static methods in 
the SatSolver class. SatSolverProxy is declared as a friend of the 
SatSolver and has all-privileges access to the internals -- use with care!!!

* Clause Database and CNF

The clause database consists of two parts:

    vec<Clause*>        clauses;          // List of problem clauses.
    vec<Clause*>        learnts;          // List of learnt clauses.

Clauses is the original problem clauses, and learnts are the clauses learned 
during the search. I have disabled removal of satisfied problem clauses by 
setting the remove_satisfied flag to false.

The learnt clauses get removed every once in a while by removing the half of
clauses with the low activity (reduceDB())

Since the clause database backtracks with the SMT solver, the CNF cache should
be context dependent and everything will be in sync. 

* Adding a Clause

The only method in the interface that allows addition of clauses in MiniSAT is

    bool Solver::addClause(vec<Lit>& ps),

but it only adds the problem clauses. 

In order to add the clauses to the removable database the interface is now 

    bool Solver::addClause(vec<Lit>& ps, bool removable).      

Clauses added with removable=true might get removed by the SAT solver when 
compacting the database.

The question is whether to add the propagation/conflict lemmas as removable or 
not?

* Literal Activities

We do not backtrack literal activities. This does not semantically change the 
equivalence of the context, but does change solve times if the same problem is
run several times.

* Do we need to assign literals that only appear in satisfied clauses?
