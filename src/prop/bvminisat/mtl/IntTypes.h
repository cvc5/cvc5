    // Not sure if there are newer versions that support C99 headers. The

// In contrast to the original MiniSat source code, we are including the
// cstdint/cinttypes/climits headers instead of stdint.h/inttypes.h/limits.h
// here. This ensures that the macros in cinttypes/inttypes.h, e.g., PRIi64,
// are actually defined. The C99 standard suggested that those macros are only
// defined for C++ code when __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS is defined. This was never
// adopted by a C++ standard (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer).
// However, certain versions of mingw-w64 seem to require it with inttypes.h
// but not cinttypes.
