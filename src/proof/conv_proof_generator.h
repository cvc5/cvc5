/**
 * The term conversion proof generator.
 *
 * This class is used for proofs of t = t', where t' is obtained from t by
 * applying (context-free) small step rewrites on subterms of t. Its main
 * interface functions are:
 * (1) addRewriteStep(t,s,<justification>) which notifies this class that t
 * rewrites to s, where justification is either a proof generator or proof
 * step,
 * (2) getProofFor(f) where f is any equality that can be justified by the
 * rewrite steps given above.
 *
 * For example, say we make the following calls:
 *   addRewriteStep(a,b,P1)
 *   addRewriteStep(f(a),c,P2)
 *   addRewriteStep(c,d,P3)
 * where P1 and P2 are proof steps. Afterwards, this class may justify any
 * equality t = s where s is obtained by applying the rewrites a->b, f(a)->c,
 * c->d, based on the strategy outlined below [***]. For example, the call to:
 *   getProofFor(g(f(a),h(a),f(e)) = g(d,h(b),f(e)))
 * will return the proof:
 *   CONG(
 *     TRANS(P2,P3),     ; f(a)=d
 *     CONG(P1 :args h), ; h(a)=h(b)
 *     REFL(:args f(e))  ; f(e)=f(e)
 *   :args g)
 *
 * [***] This class traverses the left hand side of a given equality-to-prove
 * (the term g(f(a),h(a),e) in the above example) and "replays" the rewrite
 * steps to obtain its rewritten form. To do so, it applies any available
 * rewrite step at pre-rewrite (pre-order traversal) and post-rewrite
 * (post-order traversal) based on whether the user specified pre-rewrite or a
 * post-rewrite during addRewriteStep.
 *
 * This class may additionally be used for term-context-sensitive rewrite
 * systems. An example is the term formula removal pass which rewrites
 * terms dependending on whether they occur in a "term position", for details
 * see RtfTermContext in expr/term_context.h. To use this class in a way
 * that takes into account term contexts, the user of the term conversion
 * proof generator should:
 * (1) Provide a term context callback to the constructor of this class (tccb),
 * (2) Register rewrite steps that indicate the term context identifier of
 * the rewrite, which is a uint32_t.
 *
 * For example, RtfTermContext uses hash value 2 to indicate we are in a "term
 * position". Say the user of this class calls:
 *   addRewriteStep( (and A B), BOOLEAN_TERM_VARIABLE_1, pg, true, 2)
 * This indicates that (and A B) should rewrite to BOOLEAN_TERM_VARIABLE_1 if
 * (and A B) occurs in a term position, where pg is a proof generator that can
 * provide a closed proof of:
 *   (= (and A B) BOOLEAN_TERM_VARIABLE_1)
 * Subsequently, this class may respond to a call to getProofFor on:
 *   (=
 *     (or (and A B) (P (and A B)))
 *     (or (and A B) (P BOOLEAN_TERM_VARIABLE_1)))
 * where P is a predicate Bool -> Bool. The proof returned by this class
 * involves congruence and pg's proof of the equivalence above. In particular,
 * assuming its proof of the equivalence is P1, this proof is:
 *   (CONG{=} (CONG{or} (REFL (and A B)) (CONG{P} P1)))
 * Notice the callback provided to this class ensures that the rewrite is
 * replayed in the expected way, e.g. the occurrence of (and A B) that is not
 * in term position is not rewritten.
