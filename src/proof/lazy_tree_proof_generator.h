/**
 * This class supports the lazy creation of a tree-shaped proof.
 * The core idea is that the lazy creation is necessary because proof rules
 * depend on assumptions that are only known after the whole subtree has been
 * finished.
 *
 * We indend to argue about proofs that roughly go as follows:
 * - we assume a set of assumptions
 * - we do a case split
 * - for every case, we derive false, possibly by nested case splits
 *
 * Every case is represented by a SCOPE whose child derives false. When
 * composing the final proof, we explicitly extend the premise of every proof
 * step with the scope (the currently selected case) that this proof step lives
 * in. When doing this, we ignore the outermost scope (which assumes the
 * assertion set) to allow for having conflicts that are only a subset of the
 * assertion set.
 *
 * Consider the example  x*x<1 and x>2  and the intended proof
 *  (SCOPE
 *    (ARITH_NL_CAD_SPLIT
 *      (SCOPE
 *        (ARITH_NL_CAD_DIRECT  (x<=2  and  x>2) ==> false)
 *        :args [x<=2]
 *      )
 *      (SCOPE
 *        (ARITH_NL_CAD_DIRECT  (x>=1  and  x*x<1) ==> false)
 *        :args [x>=1]
 *      )
 *    )
 *    :args [ x*x<1, x>2 ]
 *  )
 * We obtain this proof in a way that (in general) gives us the assumptions
 * for the scopes (x<=2, x>=1) only when the scope children have been fully
 * computed. Thus, we store the proof in an intermediate form and add the scope
 * arguments when we learn them. Once we have completed the proof, we can easily
 * transform it into proper ProofNodes.
 *
 * This class is stateful in the sense that the interface (in particular
 * openChild() and closeChild()) navigates the proof tree (and creating it
 * on-the-fly). Initially, and after reset() has been called, the proof consists
 * of one empty proof node (with proof rule UNKNOWN). It stores the current
 * position in the proof tree internally to make the interface easier to use.
 *
 * THIS MAKES THIS CLASS INHERENTLY NOT THREAD-SAFE!
 *
 * To construct the above proof, use this class roughly as follows:
 *  setCurrent(SCOPE, {}, assertions, false);
 *  openChild();
 *  // First nested scope
 *  openChild();
 *  setCurrent(SCOPE, {}, {}, false);
 *  openChild();
 *  setCurrent(CAD_DIRECT, {x>2}, {}, false);
 *  closeChild();
 *  getCurrent().args = {x<=2};
 *  closeChild();
 *  // Second nested scope
 *  openChild();
 *  setCurrent(SCOPE, {}, {}, false);
 *  openChild();
 *  setCurrent(CAD_DIRECT, {x*x<1}, {}, false);
 *  closeChild();
 *  getCurrent().args = {x>=1};
 *  closeChild();
 *  // Finish split
 *  setCurrent(CAD_SPLIT, {}, {}, false);
 *  closeChild();
 *  closeChild();
 *
 * To explicitly finish proof construction, we need to call closeChild() one
 * additional time.
