/**
 * A (context-dependent) proof.
 *
 * This maintains a context-dependent map from formulas to ProofNode shared
 * pointers. When a step is added, it internally uses mutable ProofNode pointers
 * to link the steps in the proof together.
 *
 * It is important to note that the premises of proof steps given to this class
 * are *Node* not *ProofNode*. In other words, the user of this class does
 * not have to manage ProofNode pointers while using this class. Instead,
 * ProofNode is the final product of this class, via the getProof interface,
 * which returns a ProofNode object that has linked together the proof steps
 * added to this object.
 *
 * Its main interface is the function addStep, which registers a single
 * step in the proof. Its interface is:
 *   addStep( <conclusion>, <rule>, <premises>, <args>, ...<options>... )
 * where conclusion is what to be proven, rule is an identifier, premises
 * are the formulas that imply conclusion, and args are additional arguments to
 * the proof rule application. The options include whether we ensure children
 * proofs already exist for the premises and our policty for overwriting
 * existing steps.
 *
 * As an example, let A, B, C, D be formulas represented by Nodes. If we
 * call:
 * - addStep( A, ID_A, { B, C }, {} )
 * - addStep( B, ID_B, { D }, {} )
 * - addStep( E, ID_E, {}, {} )
 * with default options, then getProof( A ) returns the ProofNode of the form:
 *   ID_A( ID_B( ASSUME( D ) ), ASSUME( C ) )
 * Notice that the above calls to addStep can be made in either order. The
 * proof step for E was not involved in the proof of A.
 *
 * If the user wants to combine proofs, then a addProof interface is
 * available. The method addProof can be seen as syntax sugar for making
 * multiple calls to addStep. Continuing the above example, if we call:
 * - addProof( F, ID_F( ASSUME( A ), ASSUME( E ) ) )
 * is the same as calling steps corresponding the steps in the provided proof
 * bottom-up, starting from the leaves.
 * --- addStep( A, ASSUME, {}, {}, true )
 * --- addStep( E, ASSUME, {}, {}, true )
 * --- addStep( F, ID_F, { A, E }, {}, true )
 * The fifth argument provided indicates that we want to ensure child proofs
 * are already available for the step (see ensureChildren in addStep below).
 * This will result in getProof( F ) returning:
 *   ID_F( ID_A( ID_B( ASSUME( D ) ), ASSUME( C ) ), ID_E() )
 * Notice that the proof of A by ID_A was not overwritten by ASSUME in the
 * addStep call above.
 *
 * The default policy for overwriting proof steps (CDPOverwrite::ASSUME_ONLY)
 * gives ASSUME a special status. An ASSUME step can be seen as a step whose
 * justification has not yet been provided. Thus, it is always overwritten.
 * Other proof rules are never overwritten, unless the argument opolicy is
 * CDPOverwrite::ALWAYS.
 *
 * As an another example, say that we call:
 * - addStep( B, ID_B1 {}, {} )
 * - addStep( A, ID_A1, {B, C}, {} )
 * At this point, getProof( A ) returns:
 *   ID_A1( ID_B1(), ASSUME(C) )
 * Now, assume an additional call is made to addProof, where notice
 * the overwrite policy is CDPOverwrite::ASSUME_ONLY by default:
 * - addProof( D, ID_D( ID_A2( ID_B2(), ID_C() ) ) )
 * where assume ID_B2() and ID_C() prove B and C respectively. This call is
 * equivalent to calling:
 * --- addStep( B, ID_B2, {}, {}, true )
 * --- addStep( C, ID_C, {}, {}, true )
 * --- addStep( A, ID_A2, {B, C}, {}, true )
 * --- addStep( D, ID_D, {A}, {}, true )
 * Afterwards, getProof( D ) returns:
 *   ID_D( ID_A1( ID_B1(), ID_C() ) )
 * Notice that the steps with ID_A1 and ID_B1 were not overwritten by this call,
 * whereas the assumption of C was overwritten by the proof ID_C(). Notice that
 * the proof of D was completely traversed in addProof, despite encountering
 * formulas, A and B, that were already given proof steps.
 *
 * This class requires a ProofNodeManager object, which is a trusted way of
 * allocating ProofNode pointers. This manager may have an underlying checker,
 * although this is not required. It also (optionally) takes a context c.
 * If no context is provided, then this proof is context-independent. This
 * is implemented internally by using a dummy context that is never pushed
 * or popped. The map from Nodes to ProofNodes is context-dependent and is
 * backtracked when its context backtracks.
 *
 * An important invariant of this object is that there exists (at most) one
 * proof step for each Node. Thus, the ProofNode objects returned by this
 * class share proofs for common subformulas, as guaranteed by the fact that
 * Node objects have perfect sharing.
 *
 * Notice that this class is agnostic to symmetry of equality. In other
 * words, adding a step that concludes (= x y) is effectively the same as
 * providing a step that concludes (= y x) from the point of view of a user
 * of this class. This is accomplished by adding SYMM steps on demand when
 * a formula is looked up. For example say we call:
 * - addStep( (= x y), ID_1 {}, {} )
 * - addStep( P, ID_2, {(= y x)}, {} )
 * Afterwards, getProof( P ) returns:
 *   ID_2( SYMM( ID_1() ) )
 * where notice SYMM was added so that (= y x) is a premise of the application
 * of ID_2. More generally, CDProof::isSame(F,G) returns true if F and G are
 * essentially the same formula according to this class.
