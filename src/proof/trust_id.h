   * We use :math:`\texttt{IRP}_k(poly)` for an IndexedRootPredicate that is
   * defined as the :math:`k`'th root of the polynomial :math:`poly`. Note that
   * :math:`poly` may not be univariate; in this case, the value of
   * :math:`\texttt{IRP}_k(poly)` can only be calculated with respect to a
   * (partial) model for all but one variable of :math:`poly`.
   *
   * A formula :math:`\texttt{Interval}(x_i)` describes that a variable
   * :math:`x_i` is within a particular interval whose bounds are given as IRPs.
   * It is either an open interval or a point interval:
   *
   * .. math::
   *   \texttt{IRP}_k(poly) < x_i < \texttt{IRP}_k(poly)
   *
   *   x_i = \texttt{IRP}_k(poly)
   *
   * A formula :math:`\texttt{Cell}(x_1 \dots x_i)` describes a portion
   * of the real space in the following form:
   *
   * .. math::
   *   \texttt{Interval}(x_1) \land \dots \land \texttt{Interval}(x_i)
   *
   * A cell can also be empty (for :math:`i = 0`).
   *
   * A formula :math:`\texttt{Covering}(x_i)` is a set of intervals, implying
   * that :math:`x_i` can be in neither of these intervals. To be a covering (of
   * the real line), the union of these intervals should be the real numbers.
   *
   * .. math::
   *   \inferrule{\texttt{Cell}, A \mid -}{\bot}
   *
   * A direct interval is generated from an assumption :math:`A` (in variables
   * :math:`x_1 \dots x_i`) over a :math:`\texttt{Cell}(x_1 \dots x_i)`. It
   * derives that :math:`A` evaluates to false over the cell. In the actual
   * algorithm, it means that :math:`x_i` can not be in the topmost interval of
   * the cell.
