/**
 * A manager for proof node objects. This is a trusted interface for creating
 * and updating ProofNode objects.
 *
 * In more detail, we say a ProofNode is "well-formed (with respect to checker
 * X)" if its d_proven field is non-null, and corresponds to the formula that
 * the ProofNode proves according to X. The ProofNodeManager class constructs
 * and update nodes that are well-formed with respect to its underlying checker.
 *
 * If no checker is provided, then the ProofNodeManager assigns the d_proven
 * field of ProofNode based on the provided "expected" argument in mkNode below,
 * which must be provided in this case.
 *
 * The ProofNodeManager is used as a trusted way of updating ProofNode objects
 * via updateNode below. In particular, this method leaves the d_proven field
 * unchanged and updates (if possible) the remaining content of a given proof
 * node.
 *
 * Notice that ProofNode objects are mutable, and hence this class does not
 * cache the results of mkNode. A version of this class that caches
 * immutable version of ProofNode objects could be built as an extension
 * or layer on top of this class.

   * Make scope having body pf and arguments (assumptions-to-close) assumps.
   * If ensureClosed is true, then this method throws an assertion failure if
   * the returned proof is not closed. This is the case if a free assumption
   * of pf is missing from the vector assumps.
   *
   * For conveinence, the proof pf may be modified to ensure that the overall
   * result is closed. For instance, given input:
   *   pf = TRANS( ASSUME( x=y ), ASSUME( y=z ) )
   *   assumps = { y=x, y=z }
   * This method will modify pf to be:
   *   pf = TRANS( SYMM( ASSUME( y=x ) ), ASSUME( y=z ) )
   * so that y=x matches the free assumption. The returned proof is:
   *   SCOPE(TRANS( SYMM( ASSUME( y=x ) ), ASSUME( y=z ) ) :args { y=x, y=z })
   *
   * When ensureClosed is true, duplicates are eliminated from assumps. The
   * reason for this is due to performance, since in this method, assumps is
   * converted to an unordered_set to do the above check and hence it is a
   * convienient time to eliminate duplicate literals.
   *
   * Additionally, if both ensureClosed and doMinimize are true, assumps is
   * updated to contain exactly the free asumptions of pf. This also includes
   * having no duplicates. Furthermore, if assumps is empty after minimization,
   * this method is a no-op.
   *
   * In each case, the update vector assumps is passed as arguments to SCOPE.
   *
   * @param pf The body of the proof,
   * @param assumps The assumptions-to-close of the scope,
   * @param ensureClosed Whether to ensure that the proof is closed,
   * @param doMinimize Whether to minimize assumptions.
   * @param expected the node that the scope should prove.
   * @return The scoped proof.
