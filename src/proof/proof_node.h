/** A node in a proof
 *
 * A ProofNode represents a single step in a proof. It contains:
 * (1) d_id, an identifier indicating the kind of inference,
 * (2) d_children, the child ProofNode objects indicating its premises,
 * (3) d_args, additional arguments used to determine the conclusion,
 * (4) d_proven, cache of the formula that this ProofNode proves.
 *
 * Overall, a ProofNode and its children form a directed acyclic graph.
 *
 * A ProofNode is partially mutable in that (1), (2) and (3) can be
 * modified. A motivating example of when this is useful is when a ProofNode
 * is established to be a "hole" for something to be proven later. On the other
 * hand, (4) is intended to be immutable.
 *
 * The method setValue is private and can be called by objects that manage
 * ProofNode objects in trusted ways that ensure that the node maintains
 * the invariant above. Furthermore, notice that this class is not responsible
 * for setting d_proven; this is done externally by a ProofNodeManager class.
 *
 * Notice that all fields of ProofNode are stored in ***Skolem form***. Their
 * correctness is checked in ***witness form*** (for details on this
 * terminology, see expr/skolem_manager.h). As a simple example, say a
 * theory solver has a term t, and wants to introduce a unit lemma (= k t)
 * where k is a fresh Skolem variable. It creates this variable via:
 *   k = SkolemManager::mkPurifySkolem(t,"k");
 * A checked ProofNode for the fact (= k t) then may have fields:
 *   d_rule := MACRO_SR_PRED_INTRO,
 *   d_children := {},
 *   d_args := {(= k t)}
 *   d_proven := (= k t).
 * Its justification via the rule MACRO_SR_PRED_INTRO (see documentation
 * in theory/builtin/proof_kinds) is in terms of the witness form of the
 * argument:
 *   (= (witness ((z T)) (= z t)) t)
 * which, by that rule's side condition, is such that:
 *   Rewriter::rewrite((= (witness ((z T)) (= z t)) t)) = true.
 * Notice that the correctness of the rule is justified here by rewriting
 * the witness form of (= k t). The conversion to/from witness form is
 * managed by ProofRuleChecker::check.
 *
 * An external proof checker is expected to formalize the ProofNode only in
 * terms of *witness* forms.
 *
 * However, the rest of cvc5 sees only the *Skolem* form of arguments and
 * conclusions in ProofNode, since this is what is used throughout cvc5.
