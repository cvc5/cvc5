   * Get lazy proof for fact, or nullptr if it does not exist, by connecting the
   * proof nodes generated for each intermediate relevant fact registered in the
   * chain (i.e., in the domain of d_gens).
   *
   * For example, if d_gens consists of the following pairs
   *
   * --- (A, PG1)
   * --- (B, PG2)
   * --- (C, PG3)
   *
   * and getProofFor(A) is called, with PG1 generating a proof with assumptions
   * B and D, then B is expanded, with its assumption proof node being updated
   * to the expanded proof node, while D is not. Assuming PG2 provides a proof
   * with assumptions C and E, then C is expanded and E is not. Suppose PG3
   * gives a closed proof, thus the call getProofFor(A) produces a proof node
   *
   *  A : ( ... B : ( ... C : (...), ... ASSUME( E ) ), ... ASSUME( D ) )
   *
   * Note that the expansions are done directly on the proof nodes produced by
   * the generators.
   *
   * If this instance has been set to be robust to cyclic proofs (i.e., d_cyclic
   * is true), then the construction of the proof chain checks that there are no
   * cycles, i.e., a given fact would have itself as an assumption when
   * connecting the chain links. If such a cycle were to be detected then the
   * fact will be marked as an assumption and not expanded in the final proof
   * node. The method does not fail.
