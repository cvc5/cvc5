/**
 * An eager proof generator, with explicit proof caching.
 *
 * The intended use of this class is to store proofs for lemmas and conflicts
 * at the time they are sent out on the ProofOutputChannel. This means that the
 * getProofForConflict and getProofForLemma methods are lookups in a
 * (user-context depedent) map, the field d_proofs below.
 *
 * In detail, the method setProofForConflict(conf, pf) should be called prior to
 * calling ProofOutputChannel(TrustNode(conf,X)), where X is this generator.
 * Similarly for setProofForLemma.
 *
 * The intended usage of this class in combination with OutputChannel is
 * the following:
 * //-----------------------------------------------------------
 *   class MyEagerProofGenerator : public EagerProofGenerator
 *   {
 *     public:
 *      TrustNode getProvenConflictByMethodX(...)
 *      {
 *        // construct a conflict
 *        Node conf = [construct conflict];
 *        // construct a proof for conf
 *        std::shared_ptr<ProofNode> pf = [construct the proof for conf];
 *        // wrap the conflict in a trust node
 *        return mkTrustNode(conf,pf);
 *      }
 *   };
 *   // [1] Make objects given user context u and output channel out.
 *
 *   MyEagerProofGenerator epg(u);
 *   OutputChannel out;
 *
 *   // [2] Assume epg realizes there is a conflict. We have it store the proof
 *   // internally and return the conflict node paired with epg.
 *
 *   TrustNode pconf = epg.getProvenConflictByMethodX(...);
 *
 *   // [3] Send the conflict on the output channel.
 *
 *   out.trustedConflict(pconf);
 *
 *   // [4] The trust node has information about what is proven and who can
 *   // prove it, where this association is valid in the remainder of the user
 *   // context.
 *
 *   Node conf = pconf.getProven();
 *   ProofGenerator * pg = pconf.getGenerator();
 *   std::shared_ptr<ProofNode> pf = pg->getProofForConflict(conf);
 * //-----------------------------------------------------------
 * In other words, the proof generator epg is responsible for creating and
 * storing the proof internally, and the proof output channel is responsible for
 * maintaining the map that epg is who to ask for the proof of the conflict.
