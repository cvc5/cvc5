/** A parsed operator
 *
 * The purpose of this struct is to store information regarding a parsed term
 * that might not be ready to associate with an expression.
 *
 * While parsing terms in smt2, we may store a combination of one or more of
 * the following to track how to process this term:
 * (1) A kind.
 * (2) A string name.
 * (3) An expression expr.
 * (4) A type t.
 * (5) An operator object.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * - For declared functions f that we have not yet looked up in a symbol table,
 * we store (2). We may store a name in a state if f is overloaded and we have
 * not yet parsed its arguments to know how to disambiguate f.
 * - For tuple selectors (_ tupSel n), we store (1) and (3). Kind is set to
 * APPLY_SELECTOR, and expr is set to n, which is to be interpreted by the
 * caller as the n^th generic tuple selector. We do this since there is no
 * AST expression representing generic tuple select, and we do not have enough
 * type information at this point to know the type of the tuple we will be
 * selecting from.
 * - For array constant specifications prior to type ascription e.g. when we
 * have parsed "const", we store (1), setting the kind to STORE_ALL.
 * - For array constant specifications (as const (Array T1 T2)), we store (1)
 * and (4), where kind is set to STORE_ALL and type is set to (Array T1 T2).
 * When parsing this as an operator e.g. ((as const (Array T1 T2)) t), we
 * interpret this operator by converting the next parsed constant of type T2 to
 * an Array of type (Array T1 T2) over that constant.
