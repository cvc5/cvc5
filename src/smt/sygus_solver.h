/**
 * A solver for sygus queries.
 *
 * This class is responsible for responding to check-synth commands. It calls
 * check satisfiability using a separate SolverEngine "subsolver".
 *
 * This solver operates in two modes.
 *
 * If in incremental mode, then the "main" SolverEngine for SyGuS inputs only
 * maintains a (user-context) dependent state of SyGuS assertions, as well as
 * assertions corresponding to (recursive) function definitions. The subsolver
 * that solves SyGuS conjectures may be called to checkSat multiple times,
 * however, push/pop (which impact SyGuS constraints) impacts only the main
 * solver. This means that the conjecture being handled by the subsolver is
 * reconstructed when the SyGuS conjecture is updated. The key property that
 * this enables is that the subsolver does *not* get calls to push/pop,
 * although it may receive multiple check-sat if the sygus functions and
 * constraints are not updated between check-sat calls.
 *
 * If not in incremental mode, then the internal SyGuS conjecture is asserted
 * to the "main" SolverEngine.
