 * An SMT driver that is based on deep restarts.
 *
 * The idea of this SMT driver is to call the SMT solver with all assertions
 * with learned literal tracking enabled, and where it terminates with
 * "unknown" if:
 * - at least one literal has been learned, and
 * - no literal has been learned after some threshold.
 * In this case, we preprocess and checkSat again where the SMT solver has
 * its PropEngine and TheoryEngine reset.
