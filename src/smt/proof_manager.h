/**
 * This class is responsible for managing the proof output of SolverEngine, as
 * well as setting up the global proof checker and proof node manager.
 *
 * The proof production of an SolverEngine is directly impacted by whether, and
 * how, we are producing unsat cores:
 *
 * - If we are producing unsat cores using the old proof infrastructure, then
 *   SolverEngine will not have proofs in the sense of this proof manager.
 *
 * - If we are producing unsat cores using this proof infrastructure, then the
 *   SolverEngine will have proofs using this proof manager, according to the
 * unsat core mode:
 *
 *   - assumption mode: proofs only for preprocessing, not in sat solver or
 *   theory engine, and level of granularity set to off (unless otherwise
 *   specified by the user)
 *
 *   - sat-proof mode: proofs for preprocessing + sat solver, not in theory
 *   engine and level of granularity set to off (unless otherwise specified by
 *   the user)
 *
 *   - full-proof mode: proofs for the whole solver as normal
 *
 *   Note that if --produce-proofs is set then full-proof mode of unsat cores is
 *   forced.
 *
 * - If we are not producing unsat cores then the SolverEngine will have proofs
 * as long as --produce-proofs is on.
 *
 * - If SolverEngine has been configured in a way that is incompatible with
 * proofs then unsat core production will be disabled.
