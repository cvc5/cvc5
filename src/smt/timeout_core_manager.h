/**
 * A module for computing a timeout core.
 *
 * The algorithm it uses maintains a set of formulas C and a set of models M,
 * both initially empty.
 * In each iteration of the loop:
 *   If C is unsat, return <unsat, C>
 *   If C is timeout, return <unknown, C>
 *   If C is sat or unknown with model m:
 *     If m satisfies all input formulas, return <sat, {}>
 *     Otherwise, add m to M.
 *     Update C to C' such that C'^m' = false for all models m' in M and repeat.
 *
 * The selection of C' is done by adding to C a single new assertion from our
 * input that is falsified by m, and then removing from C any assertions that
 * are not falsified by another assertion already in C'. In detail, each model
 * in M is "owned" by an assertion in C. When a new assertion is added to C,
 * it takes ownership of all models that it is falsified by.
 *
 * In the worst case, this algorithm runs N check-sat calls, where N is the
 * number of assertions, since assertions are added one at a time and if
 * an assertion is ever removed from C, it is never readded.
 *
 * On average, it is expected that timeout cores are similar in size to unsat
 * cores, so the average number of check-sat calls is roughly 25% of N
 * typically, as a very rough estimate.
 *
 * However, it is important to note that all check-sat which do not lead to
 * termination are *not* timeouts. When we encounter the first timeout, our
 * set is already minimal covering of the models we have accumulated so far.
 * This is important for performance since there is at most one *timeout* call
 * to check-sat.
