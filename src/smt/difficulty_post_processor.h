/**
 * A postprocess callback that computes difficulty based on the structure
 * of the proof. In particular, this class assesses what the source of an
 * assertion was by considering the shape of the proof. For instance, if
 * assertion A entails x=t, and this was used to derive a substitution
 * { x -> t } to assertion B, then B is the source of B*{ x -> t }. The
 * difficulty of this assertion is carried to B and not A. The reason is that
 * A can be understood as a definition, and is eliminated, whereas B was
 * persistent if B*{ x -> t } was a prepreprocessed assertion.
 *
 * Note that this postprocess callback is intended to be run on the proof
 * of a single preprocessed assertion C. If C was derived by proof with
 * free assumptions A_1, ..., A_n, then for each A_i that is a "source" as
 * described above, we increment the difficulty of A_i by the difficulty value
 * assigned to C.
 *
 * This means that the user of this method should:
 * (1) assign the current difficulty we are incrementing (setCurrentDifficulty),
 * (2) process the proof using a proof node updater with this callback.
 * The final difficulty map is accumulated in d_accMap, which can be accessed
 * at any time via getDifficultyMap.
