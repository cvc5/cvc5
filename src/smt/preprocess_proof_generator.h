/**
 * This is a proof generator that manages proofs for a set of formulas that
 * may be replaced over time. This set of formulas is implicit; formulas that
 * are not notified as assertions to this class are treated as assumptions.
 *
 * The main use case of this proof generator is for proofs of preprocessing,
 * although it can be used in other scenarios where proofs for an evolving set
 * of formulas is maintained. In the remainder of the description here, we
 * describe its role as a proof generator for proofs of preprocessing.
 *
 * This class has two main interfaces during solving:
 * (1) notifyNewAssert, for assertions that are not part of the input and are
 * added to the assertion pipeline by preprocessing passes,
 * (2) notifyPreprocessed, which is called when a preprocessing pass rewrites
 * an assertion into another.
 * Notice that input assertions do not need to be provided to this class.
 *
 * Its getProofFor method produces a proof for a preprocessed assertion
 * whose free assumptions are intended to be input assertions, which are
 * implictly all assertions that are not notified to this class.
