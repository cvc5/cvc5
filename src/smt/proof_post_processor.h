   * When given children and args lead to different sets of literals in a
   * conclusion depending on whether macro resolution or chain resolution is
   * applied, the literals that appear in the chain resolution result, but not
   * in the macro resolution result, from now on "crowding literals", are
   * literals removed implicitly by macro resolution. For example
   *
   *      l0 v l0 v l0 v l1 v l2    ~l0 v l1   ~l1
   * (1)  ----------------------------------------- MACRO_RES
   *                 l2
   *
   * but
   *
   *      l0 v l0 v l0 v l1 v l2    ~l0 v l1   ~l1
   * (2)  ---------------------------------------- CHAIN_RES
   *                l0 v l0 v l1 v l2
   *
   * where l0 and l1 are crowding literals in the second proof.
   *
   * There are two views for how MACRO_RES implicitly removes the crowding
   * literal, i.e., how MACRO_RES can be expanded into CHAIN_RES so that
   * crowding literals are removed. The first is that (1) becomes
   *
   *  l0 v l0 v l0 v l1 v l2  ~l0 v l1  ~l0 v l1  ~l0 v l1  ~l1  ~l1  ~l1  ~l1
   *  ---------------------------------------------------------------- CHAIN_RES
   *                                 l2
   *
   * via the repetition of the premise responsible for removing more than one
   * occurrence of the crowding literal. The issue however is that this
   * expansion is exponential. Note that (2) has two occurrences of l0 and one
   * of l1 as crowding literals. However, by repeating ~l0 v l1 two times to
   * remove l0, the clause ~l1, which would originally need to be repeated only
   * one time, now has to be repeated two extra times on top of that one. With
   * multiple crowding literals and their elimination depending on premises that
   * themselves add crowding literals one can easily end up with resolution
   * chains going from dozens to thousands of premises. Such examples do occur
   * in practice, even in our regressions.
   *
   * The second way of expanding MACRO_RES, which avoids this exponential
   * behavior, is so that (1) becomes
   *
   *      l0 v l0 v l0 v l1 v l2
   * (4)  ---------------------- FACTORING
   *      l0 v l1 v l2                       ~l0 v l1
   *      ------------------------------------------- CHAIN_RES
   *                   l1 v l1 v l2
   *                  ------------- FACTORING
   *                     l1 v l2                   ~l1
   *                    ------------------------------ CHAIN_RES
   *                                 l2
   *
   * This method first determines what are the crowding literals by checking
   * what literals occur in clauseLits that do not occur in targetClauseLits
   * (the latter contains the literals from the original MACRO_RES conclusion
   * while the former the literals from a direct application of CHAIN_RES). Then
   * it builds a proof such as (4) and adds the steps to cdp. The final
   * conclusion is returned.
   *
   * Note that in the example the CHAIN_RES steps introduced had only two
   * premises, and could thus be replaced by a RESOLUTION step, but since we
   * general there can be more than two premises we always use CHAIN_RES.
   *
   * @param clauseLits literals in the conclusion of a CHAIN_RESOLUTION step
   * with children and args[1:]
   * @param clauseLits literals in the conclusion of a MACRO_RESOLUTION step
   * with children and args
   * @param children a list of clauses
   * @param args a list of arguments to a MACRO_RESOLUTION step
   * @param cdp a CDProof
   * @return The resulting node of transforming MACRO_RESOLUTION into
   * CHAIN_RESOLUTION according to the above idea.
