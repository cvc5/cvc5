  /** set model core
   *
   * This function updates model m so that it has information regarding its
   * "model core". A model core for m is a substitution of the form
   *    { s1 -> m(s1), ..., sn -> m(sn) }
   *
   * The criteria for what consistutes a model core given by mode. For
   * example, if mode is ModelCoresMode::SIMPLE, then a model core
   * corresponds to a subset of assignments from the model that suffice to show
   * that the set of assertions, interpreted conjunctively, evaluates to true
   * under the substitution corresponding to the model core.
   *
   * The model core is recorded on the model object m via calls to
   * m->setUsingModelCore, m->recordModelCoreSymbol, for details see
   * smt/model.h. In particular, we call:
   *   m->usingModelCore();
   *   m->recordModelCoreSymbol(s1); ... m->recordModelCoreSymbol(sn);
   * such that { s1 -> m(s1), ..., sn -> m(sn) } is the model core computed
   * by this class.
   *
   * If m is not a model for assertions, this method returns false and m is
   * left unchanged.
