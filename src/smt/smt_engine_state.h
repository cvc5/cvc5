 * This utility is responsible for maintaining the basic state of the SmtEngine.
 *
 * It has no concept of anything related to the assertions of the SmtEngine,
 * or more generally it does not depend on Node.
 *
 * This class has three sets of interfaces:
 * (1) notification methods that are used by SmtEngine to notify when an event
 * occurs (e.g. the beginning of a check-sat call),
 * (2) maintaining the SAT and user contexts to be used by the SmtEngine,
 * (3) general information queries, including the mode that the SmtEngine is
 * in, based on the notifications it has received.
 *
 * It maintains a reference to the SmtEngine for the sake of making callbacks.
