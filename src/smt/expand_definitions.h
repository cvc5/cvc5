 * Implements expand definitions, which returns the expanded form of a term.

 * This method is similar in nature to PropEngine::preprocess in that it
 * converts a (possibly user-provided) term into the form that we pass
 * internally. However, this method can be seen as a lightweight version
 * of that method which only does enough conversions to make, e.g., get-value
 * accurate on the resulting term. Moreover, this method does not impact
 * the state of lemmas known to the PropEngine.
 *
 * This utility is not proof producing, since it should only be used for
 * getting model values.
