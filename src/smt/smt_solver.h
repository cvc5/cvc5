/**
 * A solver for SMT queries.
 *
 * This class manages the initialization of the theory engine and propositional
 * engines and implements the method for checking satisfiability of the current
 * set of assertions.
 *
 * Notice that this class is only conceptually responsible for running
 * check-sat commands and an interface for sending formulas to the underlying
 * classes. It does not implement any query techniques beyond getting the result
 * (unsat/sat/unknown) of check-sat calls. More detailed information (e.g.
 * models) can be queries using other classes that examine the state of the
 * TheoryEngine directly, which can be accessed via getTheoryEngine.
