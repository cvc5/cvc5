   * @param fvs The internal free variable list of the rule. Notice these
   * variables are normalized such that *all* proof rules use the same
   * variables, per type. In detail, the n^th argument left-to-right of a given
   * type T is the same for all rules. This is to facilitate parallel matching.
   * @param cond The conditions of the rule, normalized to fvs.
   * @param conc The conclusion of the rule, which is an equality of the form
   * (= t s), where t is specified as rewriting to s. This equality is
   * normalized to fvs.
   * @param context The term context for the conclusion of the rule. This is
   * non-null for all rules that should be applied to fixed-point. The context
   * is a lambda term that specifies the next position of the term to rewrite.
   * @param isFlatForm Whether the rule is the flat form of the actual rule
   * with the given id (the flat form of a rule is where all nested applications
   * have been replaced by fresh variables that are equated to the term they
   * replace in the conditions of the rule).
