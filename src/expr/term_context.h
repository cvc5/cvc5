 * This is an abstract class for computing "term context identifiers". A term
 * context identifier is a hash value that identifies some property of the
 * context in which a term occurs. Common examples of the implementation of
 * such a mapping are implemented in the subclasses below.
 *
 * A term context identifier is intended to be information that can be locally
 * computed from the parent's hash, and hence does not rely on maintaining
 * paths.
 *
 * In the below documentation, we write t @ [p] to a term at a given position,
 * where p is a list of indices. For example, the atomic subterms of:
 *   (and P (not Q))
 * are P @ [0] and Q @ [1,0].

/**
 * Polarity term context.
 *
 * This class computes the polarity of a term-context-sensitive term, which is
 * one of {true, false, none}. This corresponds to the value that can be
 * assigned to that term while preservering satisfiability of the overall
 * formula, or none if such a value does not exist. If not "none", this
 * typically corresponds to whether the number of NOT the formula is beneath is
 * even, although special cases exist (e.g. the first child of IMPLIES).
 *
 * For example, given the formula:
 *   (and P (not (= (f x) 0)))
 * assuming the root of this formula has true polarity, we have that:
 *   P @ [0] -> true
 *   (not (= (f x) 0)) @ [1] -> true
 *   (= (f x) 0) @ [1,0] -> false
 *   (f x) @ [1,0,0]), x @ [1,0,0,0]), 0 @ [1,0,1] -> none
 *
 * Notice that a term-context-sensitive Node is not one-to-one with Node.
 * In particular, given the formula:
 *   (and P (not P))
 * We have that the P at path [0] has polarity true and the P at path [1,0] has
 * polarity false.
 *
 * Finally, notice that polarity does not correspond to a value that the
 * formula entails. Thus, for the formula:
 *   (or P Q)
 * we have that
 *   P @ [0] -> true
 *   Q @ [1] -> true
 * although neither is entailed.
 *
 * Notice that the hash of a child can be computed from the parent's hash only.
