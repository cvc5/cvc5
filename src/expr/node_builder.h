 *
 * A builder interface for Nodes.
 *
 * The idea is to permit a flexible and efficient (in the common
 * case) interface for building Nodes.  The general pattern of use is
 * to create a NodeBuilder, set its kind, append children to it, then
 * "extract" the resulting Node.  This resulting Node may be one that
 * already exists (the NodeManager keeps a table of all Nodes in the
 * system), or may be entirely new.
 *
 * This implementation gets a bit hairy for a handful of reasons.  We
 * want a user-supplied "in-line" buffer (probably on the stack, see
 * below) to hold the children, but then the number of children must
 * be known ahead of time.  Therefore, if this buffer is overrun, we
 * need to heap-allocate a new buffer to hold the children.
 *
 * Note that as children are added to a NodeBuilder, they are stored
 * as raw pointers-to-NodeValue.  However, their reference counts are
 * carefully maintained.
 *
 * When the "in-line" buffer "d_inlineNv" is superceded by a
 * heap-allocated buffer, we allocate the new buffer (a NodeValue
 * large enough to hold more children), copy the elements to it, and
 * mark d_inlineNv as having zero children.  We do this last bit so
 * that we don't have to modify any child reference counts.  The new
 * heap-allocated buffer "takes over" the reference counts of the old
 * "in-line" buffer.  (If we didn't mark it as having zero children,
 * the destructor may improperly decrement the children's reference
 * counts.)
 *
 * There are then four normal cases at the end of a NodeBuilder's
 * life cycle:
 *
 *   0. We have a VARIABLE-kinded Node.  These are special (they have
 *      no children and are all distinct by definition).  They are
 *      really a subcase of 1(b), below.
 *   1. d_nv points to d_inlineNv: it is the backing store supplied
 *      by the user (or derived class).
 *      (a) The Node under construction already exists in the
 *          NodeManager's pool.
 *      (b) The Node under construction is NOT already in the
 *          NodeManager's pool.
 *   2. d_nv does NOT point to d_inlineNv: it is a new, larger buffer
 *      that was heap-allocated by this NodeBuilder.
 *      (a) The Node under construction already exists in the
 *          NodeManager's pool.
 *      (b) The Node under construction is NOT already in the
 *          NodeManager's pool.
 *
 * When a Node is extracted, we convert the NodeBuilder to a Node and
 * make sure the reference counts are properly maintained.  That
 * means we must ensure there are no reference-counting errors among
 * the node's children, that the children aren't re-decremented on
 * clear() or NodeBuilder destruction, and that the returned Node
 * wraps a NodeValue with a reference count of 1.
 *
 *   0.    If a VARIABLE, treat similarly to 1(b), except that we
 *         know there are no children (no reference counts to reason
 *         about) and we don't keep VARIABLE-kinded Nodes in the
 *         NodeManager pool.
 *
 *   1(a). Reference-counts for all children in d_inlineNv must be
 *         decremented, and the NodeBuilder must be marked as "used"
 *         and the number of children set to zero so that we don't
 *         decrement them again on destruction.  The existing
 *         NodeManager pool entry is returned.
 *
 *   1(b). A new heap-allocated NodeValue must be constructed and all
 *         settings and children from d_inlineNv copied into it.
 *         This new NodeValue is put into the NodeManager's pool.
 *         The NodeBuilder is marked as "used" and the number of
 *         children in d_inlineNv set to zero so that we don't
 *         decrement child reference counts on destruction (the child
 *         reference counts have been "taken over" by the new
 *         NodeValue).  We return a Node wrapper for this new
 *         NodeValue, which increments its reference count.
 *
 *   2(a). Reference counts for all children in d_nv must be
 *         decremented.  The NodeBuilder is marked as "used" and the
 *         heap-allocated d_nv deleted.  d_nv is repointed to
 *         d_inlineNv so that destruction of the NodeBuilder doesn't
 *         cause any problems.  The existing NodeManager pool entry
 *         is returned.
 *
 *   2(b). The heap-allocated d_nv is "cropped" to the correct size
 *         (based on the number of children it _actually_ has).  d_nv
 *         is repointed to d_inlineNv so that destruction of the
 *         NodeBuilder doesn't cause any problems, and the (old)
 *         value it had is placed into the NodeManager's pool and
 *         returned in a Node wrapper.
 *
 * NOTE IN 1(b) AND 2(b) THAT we can NOT create Node wrapper
 * temporary for the NodeValue in the NodeBuilder::operator Node()
 * member function.  If we create a temporary (for example by writing
 * Debug("builder") << Node(nv) << endl), the NodeValue will have its
 * reference count incremented from zero to one, then decremented,
 * which makes it eligible for collection before the builder has even
 * returned it!  So this is a no-no.
 *
 * There are also two cases when the NodeBuilder is clear()'ed:
 *
 *   1. d_nv == &d_inlineNv (NodeBuilder using the user-supplied
 *      backing store): all d_inlineNv children have their reference
 *      counts decremented, d_inlineNv.d_nchildren is set to zero,
 *      and its kind is set to UNDEFINED_KIND.
 *
 *   2. d_nv != &d_inlineNv (d_nv heap-allocated by NodeBuilder): all
 *      d_nv children have their reference counts decremented, d_nv
 *      is deallocated, and d_nv is set to &d_inlineNv.  d_inlineNv's
 *      kind is set to UNDEFINED_KIND.
 *
 * ... destruction is similar:
 *
 *   1. d_nv == &d_inlineNv (NodeBuilder using the user-supplied
 *      backing store): all d_inlineNv children have their reference
 *      counts decremented.
 *
 *   2. d_nv != &d_inlineNv (d_nv heap-allocated by NodeBuilder): all
 *      d_nv children have their reference counts decremented, and
 *      d_nv is deallocated.
