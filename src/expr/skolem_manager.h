/**
 * A manager for skolems that can be used in proofs. This is designed to be
 * a trusted interface to NodeManager::mkSkolem, where one
 * must provide a definition for the skolem they create in terms of a
 * predicate that the introduced variable is intended to witness.
 *
 * It is implemented by mapping terms to an attribute corresponding to their
 * "witness form" as described below. Hence, this class does not impact the
 * reference counting of skolem variables which may be deleted if they are not
 * used.

  /**
   * This makes a skolem of same type as bound variable v, (say its type is T),
   * whose definition is (witness ((v T)) pred). This definition is maintained
   * by this class.
   *
   * Notice that (exists ((v T)) pred) should be a valid formula. This fact
   * captures the reason for why the returned Skolem was introduced.
   *
   * Take as an example extensionality in arrays:
   *
   * (declare-fun a () (Array Int Int))
   * (declare-fun b () (Array Int Int))
   * (assert (not (= a b)))
   *
   * To witness the index where the arrays a and b are disequal, it is intended
   * we call this method on:
   *   Node k = mkSkolem( x, F )
   * where F is:
   *   (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a x) (select b x))))
   * and x is a fresh bound variable of integer type. Internally, this will map
   * k to the term:
   *   (witness ((x Int)) (=> (not (= a b))
   *                          (not (= (select a x) (select b x)))))
   * A lemma generated by the array solver for extensionality may safely use
   * the skolem k in the standard way:
   *   (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a k) (select b k))))
   * Furthermore, notice that the following lemma does not involve fresh
   * skolem variables and is valid according to the theory of arrays extended
   * with support for witness:
   *   (let ((w (witness ((x Int)) (=> (not (= a b))
   *                                   (not (= (select a x) (select b x)))))))
   *     (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a w) (select b w)))))
   * This version of the lemma, which requires no explicit tracking of free
   * Skolem variables, can be obtained by a call to getWitnessForm(...)
   * below. We call this the "witness form" of the lemma above.
   *
   * @param v The bound variable of the same type of the Skolem to create.
   * @param pred The desired property of the Skolem to create, in terms of bound
   * variable v.
   * @param prefix The prefix of the name of the Skolem
   * @param comment Debug information about the Skolem
   * @param flags The flags for the Skolem (see NodeManager::mkSkolem)
   * @param pg The proof generator for this skolem. If non-null, this proof
   * generator must respond to a call to getProofFor(exists v. pred) during
   * the lifetime of the current node manager.
   * @param retWitness Whether we wish to return the witness term for the
   * given Skolem, which notice is of the form (witness v. pred), where pred
   * is in Skolem form. A typical use case of setting this flag to true
   * is preprocessing passes that eliminate terms. Using a witness term
   * instead of its corresponding Skolem indicates that the body of the witness
   * term needs to be added as an assertion, e.g. by the term formula remover.
   * @return The skolem whose witness form is registered by this class.
