/**
 * A manager for skolems that can be used in proofs. This is designed to be
 * a trusted interface to NodeManager::mkSkolem, where one
 * must provide a definition for the skolem they create in terms of a
 * predicate that the introduced variable is intended to witness.
 *
 * It is implemented by mapping terms to an attribute corresponding to their
 * "original form" and "witness form" as described below. Hence, this class does
 * not impact the reference counting of skolem variables which may be deleted if
 * they are not used.
 *
 * We distinguish two kinds of mappings between terms and skolems:
 *
 * (1) "Original form", which associates skolems with the terms they purify.
 * This is used in mkPurifySkolem below.
 *
 * (2) "Witness form", which associates skolems with their formal definition
 * as a witness term. This is used in mkSkolem below.
 *
 * It is possible to unify these so that purification skolems for t are skolems
 * whose witness form is (witness ((x T)) (= x t)). However, there are
 * motivations not to do so. In particular, witness terms in most contexts
 * should be seen as black boxes, converting something to witness form may have
 * unintended consequences e.g. variable shadowing. In contrast, converting to
 * original form does not have these complications. Furthermore, having original
 * form greatly simplifies reasoning in the proof, in particular, it avoids the
 * need to reason about identifiers for introduced variables x.
 *
 * Furthermore, note that original form and witness form may share skolems
 * in the rare case that a witness term is purified. This is currently only the
 * case for algorithms that introduce witness, e.g. BV/set instantiation.
 *
 * Additionally, we consider a third class of skolems (mkSkolemFunction) which
 * are for convenience associated with an identifier, and not a witness term.

   * This makes a skolem of same type as bound variable v, (say its type is T),
   * whose definition is (witness ((v T)) pred). This definition is maintained
   * by this class.
   *
   * Notice that (exists ((v T)) pred) should be a valid formula. This fact
   * captures the reason for why the returned Skolem was introduced.
   *
   * Take as an example extensionality in arrays:
   *
   * (declare-fun a () (Array Int Int))
   * (declare-fun b () (Array Int Int))
   * (assert (not (= a b)))
   *
   * To witness the index where the arrays a and b are disequal, it is intended
   * we call this method on:
   *   Node k = mkSkolem( x, F )
   * where F is:
   *   (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a x) (select b x))))
   * and x is a fresh bound variable of integer type. Internally, this will map
   * k to the term:
   *   (witness ((x Int)) (=> (not (= a b))
   *                          (not (= (select a x) (select b x)))))
   * A lemma generated by the array solver for extensionality may safely use
   * the skolem k in the standard way:
   *   (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a k) (select b k))))
   * Furthermore, notice that the following lemma does not involve fresh
   * skolem variables and is valid according to the theory of arrays extended
   * with support for witness:
   *   (let ((w (witness ((x Int)) (=> (not (= a b))
   *                                   (not (= (select a x) (select b x)))))))
   *     (=> (not (= a b)) (not (= (select a w) (select b w)))))
   * This version of the lemma, which requires no explicit tracking of free
   * Skolem variables, can be obtained by a call to getWitnessForm(...)
   * below. We call this the "witness form" of the lemma above.
   *
   * @param v The bound variable of the same type of the Skolem to create.
   * @param pred The desired property of the Skolem to create, in terms of bound
   * variable v.
   * @param prefix The prefix of the name of the Skolem
   * @param comment Debug information about the Skolem
   * @param flags The flags for the Skolem (see NodeManager::mkSkolem)
   * @param pg The proof generator for this skolem. If non-null, this proof
   * generator must respond to a call to getProofFor(exists v. pred) during
   * the lifetime of the current node manager.
   * @return The skolem whose witness form is registered by this class.
