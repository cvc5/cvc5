/**
 * A manager for skolems that can be used in proofs. This is designed to be
 * a trusted interface for constructing variables of SKOLEM type, where one
 * must provide information that characterizes the skolem. This information
 * may either be:
 * (1) the term that the skolem purifies (`mkPurifySkolem`)
 * (2) an identifier (`mkSkolemFunction`) and a set of "cache values", which
 * can be seen as arguments to the skolem function. These are typically used for
 * implementing theory-specific inferences that introduce symbols that
 * are not interpreted by the theory (see SkolemFunId enum).
 *
 * Note that (1) is a special instance of (2), where the purification skolem
 * for t is equivalent to calling mkSkolemFunction on SkolemFunId::PURIFY
 * and t.
 *
 * If a variable cannot be associated with any of the above information,
 * the method `mkDummySkolem` may be used, which always constructs a fresh
 * skolem variable.
 *
 * It is implemented by mapping terms to an attribute corresponding to their
 * "original form" as described below. Hence, this class does not impact the
 * reference counting of skolem variables which may be deleted if they are not
 * used.
 *
 * To handle purification of witness terms, notice that the purification
 * skolem for (witness ((x T)) P) is equivalent to the skolem function:
 *    (QUANTIFIERS_SKOLEMIZE (exists ((x T)) P) 0)
 * In other words, the purification for witness terms are equivalent to
 * the skolemization of their corresponding existential. This is currently only
 * used for eliminating witness terms coming from algorithms that introduce
 * them, e.g. BV/set instantiation. Unifying these two skolems is required
 * for ensuring proof checking succeeds for term formula removal on witness
 * terms.
 *
 * The use of purification skolems and skolem functions avoid having to reason
 * about witness terms. This avoids several complications. In particular,
 * witness terms in most contexts should be seen as black boxes, converting
 * something to a witness term may have unintended consequences e.g. variable
 * shadowing. In contrast, converting to original form does not have these
 * complications. Furthermore, having original form greatly simplifies
 * reasoning in the proof in certain external proof formats, in particular, it
 * avoids the need to reason about identifiers for introduced variables for
 * the binders of witness terms.
