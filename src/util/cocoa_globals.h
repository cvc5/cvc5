 * Singleton CoCoA global manager.
 *
 * A manager must be created before most CoCoA operations are performed.
 *
 * It must be created **exactly once** (per process, we believe). Creating it
 * multiple times raises an exception.
 *
 * It is never directly used by our code: no component of our code accesses it.
 *
 * Thus, we store it on a heap, with a static pointer to it. It is thus shared
 * across the entire process (and in particular, all cvc5 solvers).
