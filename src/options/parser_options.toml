# this is to support security in the online version, and in other similar
# contexts (--no-include-file disables filesystem access in TPTP and SMT2
# parsers) the name --no-include-file is legacy: it also now limits any
# filesystem access (read or write) for example by using --dump-to (or the
# equivalent set-option) or set-option
# :regular-output-channel/:diagnostic-output-channel.  However, the main driver
# is still permitted to read the input file given on the command-line if any.
# creation/use of temp files are still permitted (but the paths aren't given by
# the user).  Also note this is only safe for the version invoked through the
# main driver, there are ways via the API to get the cvc5 library to open a file
# for reading or writing and thus leak information from an existing file, or
# overwrite an existing file with malicious content.
