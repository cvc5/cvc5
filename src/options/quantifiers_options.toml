# Trigger selection mode.
#
# These modes are used for determining which terms to select
# as triggers for quantified formulas, when necessary, during E-matching.
# In the following, note the following terminology. A trigger is a set of terms,
# where a single trigger is a singleton set and a multi-trigger is a set of more
# than one term.
#
# MIN selects single triggers of minimal term size.
# MAX selects single triggers of maximal term size.
#
# For example, consider the quantified formula :
#   forall xy. P( f( g( x, y ) ) ) V Q( f( x ), y )
#
# MIN will select g( x, y ) and Q( f( x ), y ).
# MAX will select P( f( g( x ) ) ) and Q( f( x ), y ).
#
# The remaining three trigger selections make a difference for multi-triggers
# only. For quantified formulas that require multi-triggers, we build a set of
# partial triggers that don't contain all variables, call this set S. Then,
# multi-triggers are built by taking a random subset of S that collectively
# contains all variables.
#
# Consider the quantified formula :
#   forall xyz. P( h( x ), y ) V Q( y, z )
#
# For ALL and MIN_SINGLE_ALL,
#   S = { h( x ), P( h( x ), y ), Q( y, z ) }.
# For MIN_SINGLE_MAX,
#   S = { P( h( x ), y ), Q( y, z ) }.
#
# Furthermore, MIN_SINGLE_ALL and MIN_SINGLE_MAX, when
# selecting single triggers, only select terms of minimal size.
