/**
 * A flexible let binding class. This class provides functionalities for
 * printing letified terms. A simple use case is the following for Node n
 * and LetBinding lbind:
 * ```
 *   std::vector<Node> letList;
 *   lbind.letify(n, letList);
 * ```
 * Now, letList contains a list of subterms of n that should be letified based
 * on the threshold value passed to this class where a value n>0 indicates that
 * terms with n or more occurrences should be letified.
 *
 * The above is equivalent to:
 * ```
 *   std::vector<Node> letList;
 *   lbind.pushScope();
 *   lbind.process(n);
 *   lbind.letify(letList);
 * ```
 * In fact, multiple terms can be passed to calls to process, in which case the
 * counting is cumulative.
 *
 * All quantified formulas are treated as black boxes. This class can be used
 * to letify terms with quantifiers, where multiple calls to pushScope /
 * popScope can be used. In particular, consider:
 * ```
 *   std::vector<Node> letList1;
 *   lbind.letify(n1, letList1);
 *   std::vector<Node> letList2;
 *   lbind.letify(n2, letList2);
 *   ...
 *   lbind.popScope();
 *   lbind.popScope();
 * ```
 * In a typical use case, n2 is the body of a quantified formula that is a
 * subterm of n1. We have that letList2 is the list of subterms of n2 that
 * should be letified, assuming that we have already have let definitions
 * given by letList1.
 *
 * Internally, a let binding is a list and a map that can be printed as a let
 * expression. In particular, the list d_letList is ordered such that
 * d_letList[i] does not contain subterm d_letList[j] for j>i.
 * It is intended that d_letList contains only unique nodes. Each node
 * in d_letList is mapped to a unique identifier in d_letMap.
 *
 * Notice that this class will *not* use introduced let symbols when converting
 * the bodies of quantified formulas. Consider the formula:
 * (let ((Q (forall ((x Int)) (= x (+ a a))))) (and (= (+ a a) (+ a a)) Q Q))
 * where "let" above is from the user. When this is letified by this class,
 * note that (+ a a) occurs as a subterm of Q, however it is not seen until
 * after we have seen Q twice, since we traverse in reverse topological order.
 * Since we do not traverse underneath quantified formulas, this means that Q
 * may be marked as a term-to-letify before (+ a a), which leads to violation
 * of the above invariant concerning containment. Thus, when converting, if
 * a let symbol is introduced for (+ a a), we will not replace the occurence
 * of (+ a a) within Q. Instead, the user of this class is responsible for
 * letifying the bodies of quantified formulas independently.
