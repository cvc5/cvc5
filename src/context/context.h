/**
 * This is an abstract base class from which all objects that are
 * context-dependent should inherit.  For any data structure that you
 * want to have be automatically backtracked, do the following:
 *
 * 1. Create a class for the data structure that inherits from ContextObj
 *
 * 2. Implement save()
 *    The role of save() is to create a new ContexObj object that contains
 *    enough information to restore the object to its current state, even if
 *    it gets changed later.  Note that save should call the (default)
 *    ContextObj Copy Constructor to copy the information in the base class.
 *    It is recommended that any memory allocated by save() should be done
 *    through the ContextMemoryManager.  This way, it does not need to be
 *    explicitly freed when restore is called.  However, it is only required
 *    that the ContextObj itself be allocated using the
 *    ContextMemoryManager.  If other memory is allocated not using the
 *    ContextMemoryManager, it should be freed when restore() is called.  In
 *    fact, any clean-up work on a saved object must be done by restore().
 *    This is because the destructor is never called explicitly on saved
 *    objects.
 *
 * 3. Implement restore()
 *    The role of restore() is, given the ContextObj returned by a previous
 *    call to save(), to restore the current object to the state it was in
 *    when save() was called.  Note that the implementation of restore does
 *    *not* need to worry about restoring the base class data.  This is done
 *    automatically.  Ideally, restore() should not have to free any memory
 *    as any memory allocated by save() should have been done using the
 *    ContextMemoryManager (see item 2 above).
 *
 * 4. In the subclass implementation, any time the state is about to be
 *    changed, first call makeCurrent().
 *
 * 5. In the subclass implementation, the destructor should call destroy(),
 *    which repeatedly calls restore() until the object is restored to context
 *    level 0.  Note, however, that if there is additional cleanup required at
 *    level 0, destroy() does not do this.  It has to be implemented in the
 *    destructor of the subclass.  The reason the destroy() functionality
 *    cannot be in the ContextObj destructor is that it needs to call the
 *    subclass-specific restore() method in order to properly clean up saved
 *    copies.
 *
 * GOTCHAS WHEN ALLOCATING CONTEXTUAL OBJECTS WITH NON-STANDARD ALLOCATORS
 *
 * Be careful if you intend to allocate ContextObj in (for example)
 * ContextMemoryManager memory.  ContextMemoryManager doesn't call the
 * destructors of contained objects, which means the objects aren't
 * properly unregistered from the Context (as in point #5, above).
 * This can be remedied by allocating the ContextObj in the "top
 * scope" rather than the "bottom scope" (which is what the
 * "allocatedInCMM" flag to the special constructor in ContextObj
 * does).
 *
 * But why allocate in CMM if it's so complicated?  There's a big
 * advantage: you don't have to track the lifetime of the ContextObj.
 * The object simply ceases to exist when the Context is popped.  Thus
 * you can create an object in context memory, and if you stow
 * pointers to it only in context memory as well, all is cleaned up
 * for you when the scope pops.  Here's a list of gotchas:
 *
 * 1. For data structures intended solely to be allocated in context
 *    memory, privately declare (but don't define) an operator
 *    new(size_t) and destructor (as currently in the Link class, in
 *    src/theory/uf/ecdata.h).
 *
 * 2. For data structures that may or may not be allocated in context
 *    memory, and are designed to be that way (esp. if they contain
 *    ContextObj instances), they should be heavily documented --
 *    especially the destructor, since it _may_or_may_not_be_called_.
 *
 * 3. There's also an issue for generic code -- some class Foo<T>
 *    might be allocated in context memory, and that might normally be
 *    fine, but if T is a ContextObj this requires certain care.
 *
 * 4. Note that certain care is required for ContextObj inside of data
 *    structures.  If the (enclosing) data structure can be allocated
 *    in CMM, that means the (enclosed) ContextObj can be, even if it
 *    was not designed to be allocated in that way.  In many
 *    instances, it may be required that data structures enclosing
 *    ContextObj be parameterized with a similar "bool allocatedInCMM"
 *    argument as the special constructor in this class (and pass it
 *    on to all ContextObj instances).
