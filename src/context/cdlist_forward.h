 * This is a forward declaration header to declare the
 * CDList<> template
 *
 * It's useful if you want to forward-declare CDList<> without including the
 * full cdlist.h or cdlist_context_memory.h header, for example, in a public
 * header context, or to keep compile times low when only a forward declaration
 * is needed.
 *
 * Note that all specializations of the template should be listed
 * here as well, since different specializations are defined in
 * different headers (cdlist.h and cdlist_context_memory.h).
 * Explicitly declaring both specializations here ensure that if you
 * define one, you'll get an error if you didn't include the correct
 * header (avoiding different, incompatible instantiations in
 * different compilation units).
