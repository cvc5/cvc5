# The GitHub action for caching currently does not support modifying an
# already existing cache. We thus have a few different possibilities:
# - If having (partially) outdated data in the cached directory is fine, we
#   may want to restore any old cache via `restore-keys`. We should try hard
#   to detect that we have (partially) outdated data and make sure that the
#   updated data is stored to a new cache key.
# - If a cache is updated frequently (i.e. almost with every commit), we
#   should use the current commit hash as suffix and use `restore-keys` to
#   restore the cache from the previous commit.
#
# We define three caches: ccache, contrib and deps.
# - ccache changes with (almost) every commit and handles outdated contents
#   properly. We thus use `restore-keys` and store a new cache for every
#   commit.
# - contrib (deps/) does not handle outdated contents gracefully. As it is
#   not updated frequently, we completely rebuild it whenever it might
#   change, which is when the contrib scripts or the CI config changes.
# - deps (build/deps/) does handle outdated contents gracefully, but does
#   not change frequently. We thus use `restore-keys` to restore any recent
#   cache, but only store a new cache if the cmake or CI config changes.
#
# All caches are separated by operating system. Both ccache and deps are
# additionally separated by `cache-key`, i.e. the CI job type, because they
# depend on the configured compiler.
