The source code of CVC4 is open and available to students, researchers,
software companies, and everyone else to study, to modify, and to redistribute
original or modified versions; distribution is under the terms of the modified
BSD license (reproduced below).  Please note that CVC4 can be configured
(however, by default it is not) to link against some GPLed libraries, and
therefore the use of these builds may be restricted in non-GPL-compatible
projects.  See below for a discussion of CLN, GLPK, and Readline (the three
GPLed optional library dependences for CVC4), and how to ensure you have a
build that doesn't link against GPLed libraries.

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against CLN, the Class Library for
Numbers, available here:

  http://www.ginac.de/CLN/

Please be advised that as this library is covered under the GPLv3, if you
choose to use the combined work, "CVC4+CLN," by building CVC4 with CLN,
then it is also covered under the GPLv3.  If you want to make sure you build
a version of CVC4 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure CVC4 with the
"--bsd" option before building (which is the default).  CVC4 can then be used
in contexts where you want to license CVC4 under the (modified) BSD license.

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against GLPK, the GNU Linear
Programming Kit, available here:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/

Please be advised that as this library is covered under the GPLv3, if
you choose to use the combined work, "CVC4+GLPK," by building CVC4 with
GLPK, then it is also covered under the GPLv3.  If you want to make sure you
build a version of CVC4 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure CVC4 with the
"--bsd" option before building (which is the default).  CVC4 can then be used
in contexts where you want to license CVC4 under the (modified) BSD license.

CVC4 can be optionally configured to link against GNU Readline for improved
text-editing support in interactive mode.  GNU Readline is available here:

  http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

Please be advised that as this library is covered under the GPLv3, if
you choose to use the combined work, "CVC4+Readline," by building CVC4 with
Readline, then it is also covered under the GPLv3.  If you want to make sure
you build a version of CVC4 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure CVC4 with
the "--bsd" option before building (which is the default).  CVC4 can then be
used in contexts where you want to license CVC4 under the (modified) BSD
license.
