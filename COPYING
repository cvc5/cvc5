(however, by default it is not) to link against some GPLed libraries, and
therefore the use of these builds may be restricted in non-GPL-compatible
projects.  See below for a discussion of CLN and GLPK (the two GPLed optional
library dependences for cvc5), and how to ensure you have a build that doesn't
link against GPLed libraries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Third-Party Software
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cvc5 source code includes third-party software which has its own copyright
and licensing terms, as described below.

cvc5 incorporates MiniSat code (see src/prop/minisat),
excluded from the above copyright. See licenses/minisat-LICENSE
for copyright and licensing information.

cvc5 by default links against The GNU Multiple Precision (GMP) Arithmetic
Library, which is licensed under GNU LGPL v3.  See the file
licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt for a copy of that license.  Note that according to the
terms of the LGPL, both cvc5's source, and the combined work (cvc5 linked with
GMP) may (and do) remain under the more permissive modified BSD license.

cvc5 also links against the CaDiCaL library
(https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical), which is licensed under
the MIT license.
See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arminbiere/cadical/master/LICENSE
for copyright and licensing information.  Linking cvc5 against
this library does not affect the license terms of the cvc5 code.

The implementation of the floating point solver in cvc5 depends on symfpu
(https://github.com/martin-cs/symfpu) written by Martin Brain.
See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-cs/symfpu/CVC4/LICENSE for
copyright and licensing information.

When building with GCC, cvc5 links against the libgcc and libstdc++ libraries,
which are licensed under the GNU GPL v3 with the GCC Runtime Library exception.
See the files licenses/gpl-3.0.txt and licenses/GCC-exception-3.1.txt for
a copy of the license and the exception, respectively. Note that according to
the terms of GPLv3 with the GCC-exception, both cvc5's source, and
the combined work (cvc5 linked with the libraries) may (and do) remain under
the more permissive modified BSD license.

When building with LLVM Clang, cvc5 links against the libc++ library,
which is licensed under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions.
See the file licenses/apache-2.0-with-llvm-exceptions.txt for a copy.
Note that according to the terms of the license, both cvc5's source, and
the combined work (cvc5 linked with the library) may (and do) remain under
the more permissive modified BSD license.

cvc5 optionally links against the following libraries:

  CryptoMiniSat      (https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat)
  Kissat             (https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat)
  LibPoly            (https://github.com/SRI-CSL/libpoly)
  libedit            (https://thrysoee.dk/editline)

Linking cvc5 against these libraries does not affect the license terms of the
cvc5 code.  See the respective projects for copyright and licensing
information.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OPTIONAL GPLv3 libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please be advised that the following libraries are covered under the GPLv3
license.  If you choose to link cvc5 against one of these libraries, the
resulting combined work is also covered under the GPLv3. If you want to make
sure you build a version of cvc5 that uses no GPLed libraries, configure cvc5
with the "--no-gpl" option before building (which is the default).  cvc5 can
then be used in contexts where you want to use cvc5 under the terms of the
(modified) BSD license.  See licenses/gpl-3.0.txt for more information.

cvc5 can be optionally configured to link against CLN, the Class Library for
Numbers, available here:

  http://www.ginac.de/CLN/

cvc5 can be optionally configured to link against glpk-cut-log, a modified
version of GLPK, the GNU Linear Programming Kit, available here:

  https://github.com/timothy-king/glpk-cut-log

cvc5 can be optionally configured to link against CoCoALib, a C++ library for
doing Computations in Commutative Algebra, available here:

  https://cocoa.altervista.org/cocoalib/index.shtml
