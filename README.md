cvc5
===============================================================================

cvc5 is a tool for determining the satisfiability of a first order formula
modulo a first order theory (or a combination of such theories).  It is the
fifth in the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (CVC, CVC Lite,
CVC3, CVC4) but does not directly incorporate code from any previous version
prior to CVC4.

If you are using cvc5 in your work, or incorporating it into software of your
own, we invite you to send us a description and link to your
project/software, so that we can link it on our [Third Party
Applications](https://cvc4.github.io/third-party-applications.html) page.

cvc5 is intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine.  It can be used as a
stand-alone tool or as a library.  It has been designed to increase the
performance and reduce the memory overhead of its predecessors.  It is written
entirely in C++ and is released under an open-source software license (see file
[COPYING](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/blob/master/COPYING)).
