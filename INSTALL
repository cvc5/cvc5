CVC4 release version 1.5.

*** Quick-start instructions

*** Build dependences

The following tools and libraries are required to build and run CVC4.
Versions given are minimum versions; more recent versions should be
compatible.

  GNU C and C++ (gcc and g++), reasonably recent versions
  GNU Make
  GNU Bash
  GMP v4.2 (GNU Multi-Precision arithmetic library)
  MacPorts   [only if on a Mac; see below]
  libantlr3c v3.2 or v3.4 (ANTLR parser generator C support library)
  The Boost C++ base libraries

The hardest to obtain and install is the libantlr3c requirement, so
that one is explained next.

On a Mac, you need to additionally install MacPorts (see
http://www.macports.org/).  Doing so is easy.  Then, simply run the
script contrib/mac-build, which installs a few ports from the MacPorts
repository, then compiles and installs antlr3c using the get-antlr-3.4
script (as described next).  The mac-build script should set you up
with all requirements, and will tell you how to configure CVC4 when it
completes successfully.

If "make" is non-GNU on your system, make sure to invoke "gmake" (or
whatever GNU Make is installed as).  If your usual shell is not Bash,
the configure script should auto-correct this.  If it does not, you'll
see strange shell syntax errors, and you may need to explicitly set
SHELL or CONFIG_SHELL to the location of bash on your system.

*** Installing libantlr3c: ANTLR parser generator C support library

For libantlr3c, you can use the convenience script in
contrib/get-antlr-3.4 --this will download, patch, and install
libantlr3c.  On a 32-bit machine, or if you have difficulty building
libantlr3c (or difficulty getting CVC4 to link against it later), you
may need to remove the --enable-64bit part in the script.  (If you're
curious, the manual instructions are at
http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/wiki/Developer%27s_Guide#ANTLR3 .)

*** Building CVC4

The hardest build dependence to satisfy is libantlr3c; that's why it
is explained above.  Problems in satisfying other build dependences are
explained below.

Once the build dependences are satisfied, you should be able to
configure, make, make check, and make install without incident:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure   [use --prefix to specify a prefix; default /usr/local]
    make
    make check    [optional but a good idea!]

To build from a repository checkout (rather than a distributed CVC4
tarball), there are additional dependences; see below.

You can then "make install" to install in the prefix you gave to
the configure script (/usr/local by default).  ** You should run
"make check" ** before installation to ensure that CVC4 has been
built correctly.  In particular, GCC version 4.5.1 seems to have a
bug in the optimizer that results in incorrect behavior (and wrong
results) in many builds.  This is a known problem for Minisat, and
since Minisat is at the core of CVC4, a problem for CVC4.  "make check"
easily detects this problem (by showing a number of FAILed test cases).
It is ok if the unit tests aren't run as part of "make check", but all
system tests and regression tests should pass without incident.

To build API documentation, use "make doc".  Documentation is produced
under doc/ but is not installed by "make install".

Examples and tutorials are not installed with "make install."  You may
want to "make install-examples".  See below.

For more information about the build system itself (probably not
necessary for casual users), see the Appendix at the bottom of this
file.

*** Installing the Boost C++ base libraries

A Boost package is available on most Linux distributions; check yours
for a package named something like libboost-dev or boost-devel.  There
are a number of additional Boost packages in some distributions, but
this "basic" one should be sufficient for building CVC4.

Should you want to install Boost manually, or to learn more about the
Boost project, please visit http://www.boost.org/.

*** Optional requirements

None of these is required, but can improve CVC4 as described below:

  Optional: SWIG 2.0.x (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator)
  Optional: CLN v1.3 or newer (Class Library for Numbers)
  Optional: glpk-cut-log (A fork of the GNU Linear Programming Kit)
  Optional: ABC library (for improved bitvector support)
  Optional: GNU Readline library (for an improved interactive experience)
  Optional: The Boost C++ threading library (libboost_thread)
  Optional: CxxTest unit testing framework

SWIG is necessary to build the Java API (and of course a JDK is
necessary, too).  SWIG 1.x won't work; you'll need 2.0, and the more
recent the better.  On Mac, we've seen SWIG segfault when generating
CVC4 language bindings; version 2.0.8 or higher is recommended to
avoid this.  See "Language bindings" below for build instructions.

CLN is an alternative multiprecision arithmetic package that can offer
better performance and memory footprint than GMP.  CLN is covered by
the GNU General Public License, version 3; so if you choose to use
CVC4 with CLN support, you are licensing CVC4 under that same license.
(Usually CVC4's license is more permissive than GPL is; see the file
COPYING in the CVC4 source distribution for details.)  Please visit
http://www.ginac.de/CLN/ for more details about CLN.

glpk-cut-log is a fork of GLPK (the GNU Linear Programming Kit).
This can be used to speed up certain classes of problems for the arithmetic
implementation in CVC4. (This is not recommended for most users.) The source
code for glpk-cut-log is available at:
https://github.com/timothy-king/glpk-cut-log/
The only option for installation of glpk-cut-log is downloading the library,
compiling and installing it manually.  CVC4 is no longer compatible with the
main GLPK library. GLPK and glpk-cut-log are covered by the GNU General Public
License, version 3; so if you choose to use CVC4 with GLPK support, you are
licensing CVC4 under that same license.
(Usually CVC4's license is more permissive; see above discussion.)
Please visit http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/ for more details about GLPK.

ABC: A System for Sequential Synthesis and Verification is a library
for synthesis and verification of logic circuits. This can be used to
speed up the eager bit-vector solver by first encoding the bit-blasted
formula into AIG format and then using ABC to simplify the AIG. To
install abc run the contrib/get-abc script which will download and
install a compatible version of ABC in the cvc4 directory. To configure
CVC4 to use abc configure with --with-abc and --with-abc-dir=PATH, where
PATH corresponds to the install path of ABC. To run CVC4 using ABC use
the --bitblast-aig command line argument.
Please visit http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ for more details
on ABC.

The GNU Readline library is optionally used to provide command
editing, tab completion, and history functionality at the CVC prompt
(when running in interactive mode).  Check your distribution for a
package named "libreadline-dev" or "readline-devel" or similar.  This
library is covered by the GNU General Public License, version 3.  Like
the above-mentioned libraries, if you choose to use CVC4 with readline
support, you are licensing CVC4 under that same license.  (Please visit
http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html for more
details about readline.)

The Boost C++ threading library (often packaged independently of the
Boost base library) is needed to run CVC4 in "portfolio"
(multithreaded) mode.  Check your distribution for a package named
"libboost-thread-dev" or similar.

CxxTest is necessary to run CVC4's unit tests (included with the
distribution).  Running these is not really required for users of
CVC4; "make check" will skip unit tests if CxxTest isn't available,
and go on to run the extensive system- and regression-tests in the
source tree.  However, if you're interested, you can download CxxTest
at http://cxxtest.com/ .

*** Language bindings

There are several options available for using CVC4 from the API.

First, CVC4 offers a complete and flexible API for manipulating
expressions, maintaining a stack of assertions, and checking
satisfiability, and related things.  The C++ libraries (libcvc4.so and
libcvc4parser.so) and required headers are installed normally via a
"make install".  This API is also available from Java (via CVC4.jar
and libcvc4jni.so) by configuring with --enable-language-bindings=java.
You'll also need SWIG 2.0 installed (and you might need to help
configure find it if you installed it in a nonstandard place with
--with-swig-dir=/path/to/swig/installation).  You may also need to
give the configure script the path to your Java headers (in
particular, jni.h).  You might do so with (for example):

  ./configure --enable-language-bindings=java \
      JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include

There is also a "C++ compatibility API" (#include <cvc4/cvc3_compat.h>
and link against libcvc4compat.so) that attempts to maintain
source-level backwards-compatibility with the CVC3 C++ API.  The
compatibility library is built by default, and
--enable-language-bindings=java enables the Java compatibility library
(CVC4compat.jar and libcvc4compatjni.so).
--enable-language-bindings=c enables the C compatibility library
(#include <cvc4/bindings/compat/c/c_interface.h> and link against
libcvc4bindings_c_compat.so), and if you want both C and Java
bindings, use --enable-language-bindings=c,java.  These compatibility
language bindings do NOT require SWIG.

The examples/ directory includes some basic examples (the "simple vc"
and "simple vc compat" family of examples) of all these interfaces.

In principle, since we use SWIG to generate the native Java API, we
could support other languages as well.  However, using CVC4 from other
languages is not supported, nor expected to work, at this time.  If
you're interested in helping to develop, maintain, and test a language
binding, please contact one of the project leaders.

*** Building CVC4 from a repository checkout

CVC4's main repository is kept on GitHub at:

  https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4

and there are numerous experimental forks housed on GitHub as well,
by different developers, implementing various features.

The following tools and libraries are additionally required to build
CVC4 from from a repository checkout rather than from a prepared
source tarball.

  Automake v1.11 or later
  Autoconf v2.61 or later
  Libtool v2.2 or later
  ANTLR3 v3.2 or v3.4 

First, use "./autogen.sh" to create the configure script.  Then
proceed as normal for any distribution tarball.  The parsers are
pre-generated for the tarballs, but don't exist in the repository;
hence the extra ANTLR3 requirement to generate the source code for the
parsers, when building from the repository.

*** Examples and tutorials are not built or installed

Examples are not built by "make" or "make install".  See
examples/README for information on what to find in the examples/
directory, as well as information about building and installing them.

*** Appendix: Build architecture

The build system is generated by automake, libtool, and autoconf.  It
is somewhat nonstandard, though, which (for one thing) requires that
GNU Make be used.  If you ./configure in the top-level source
directory, the objects will actually all appear in
builds/${arch}/${build_id}.  This is to allow multiple, separate
builds in the same place (e.g., an assertions-enabled debugging build
alongside a production build), without changing directories at the
shell.  The "current" build is maintained until you re-configure.

You can also create your own build directory inside or outside of the
source tree and configure from there.  All objects will then be built
in that directory, and you'll ultimately find the "cvc4" binary in
src/main/, and the libraries under src/ and src/parser/.
