# Build the python wheel for cvc5 with a given python interpreter and additional
# configuration arguments in a clean build folder.
# Call as follows:
#   contrib/packaging_python/mk_clean_wheel.sh /usr/bin/python3 "--cadical"
#
# The script first sets up a python venv with the given interpreter and installs
# some requirements in this venv. It then uses the mk_build_dir.py script to
# prepare a fresh build folder build_wheel/ and builds the wheel in there using
# mk_wheel.py. The wheel is fixes (using auditwheel or delocate-wheel) and
# copied out of the build folder.
